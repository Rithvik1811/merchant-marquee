"""
Persistence for the `jobs` and `seller_direction` tables (RR, Phase 1).

Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §7.2 (the table listing) and
§5.1 (Ingest Node — "a new `jobs` row ... with status `ingested`; a
`seller_direction` row if any intake field was filled"). This module is the
persistence layer only: raw DDL + async read/write helpers wired to the C1
`ProductCutState` shape. It is NOT the Ingest Node, not an LLM agent, and not
the intake form — those are separate tasks.

Design choices
--------------
* **Async psycopg (psycopg 3).** Matches the established DB-access style in
  `graph/build.py`, which drives the real RDS instance via
  `AsyncPostgresSaver` (async, psycopg-backed). No SQLAlchemy ORM / Core layer
  and no migration framework (Alembic) is introduced — for two small tables in
  a hackathon Phase 1 an idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is the right
  amount of machinery, and staying on raw async psycopg keeps one DB idiom in
  the codebase rather than two.
* **C1 types are imported, never redefined.** `SellerDirection` and
  `ReferenceAd` come from `graph.state`, the same reuse pattern already used by
  `graph/events.py` and `graph/shot_schema.py`.
* **Nullability.** Every `seller_direction` column except the `job_id` PK/FK is
  nullable, matching `SellerDirection`'s `total=False` (all fields optional). A
  job with no intake at all simply has **no** `seller_direction` row (we skip
  the write); reads then omit the `seller_direction` key entirely, which is the
  faithful round-trip of "no direction given".
