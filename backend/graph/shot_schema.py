"""
C3 — Shot-list JSON schema (first cut, Phase 0; frozen at end of Phase 2).

`graph.state.Shot` / `graph.state.ShotJustification` (C1) define the *shape*
of a shot for typing purposes, but a `TypedDict` performs no runtime checks --
anything can be assigned to it. C3 exists because the Shot-List Agent's raw
LLM output needs actual mechanical validation before it's trusted, per
docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §2.2 ("each reasoning node's output schema is
a Pydantic model; a post-call deterministic validator function ... checks
the justification fields"). This module is that Pydantic model.

Scope, deliberately narrow: this is the *structural* schema check only --
right field types, right enum values, required fields present, and no
forbidden fields (see below). It is NOT the semantic Justification Validator
(verbatim script_quote check, truth_fact_id existence check, treatment_ref
cross-reference, stoplist rejection) -- that is a separate Phase 2 deliverable
owned by KR (docs/BUILD_TASKS.md, Phase 2), since it requires cross-referencing
the actual script/truths/treatment, not just validating one shot's shape.

The single hard rule this DOES mechanically enforce: **no `product_category`
field, ever** -- `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` means a shot
carrying that field (or any other undeclared field) fails validation outright,
rather than relying on a prompt instruction the LLM might ignore. This is the
concrete mechanism behind the project's core anti-genericness design pillar.

The enum literals below are hand-kept in sync with `graph.state.Shot`'s
inline Literals (TypedDict Literals aren't separately importable without
refactoring state.py, which is out of scope here -- state.py is C1's frozen
contract). If C1's Shot literals change, update these to match and bump the
version below.
