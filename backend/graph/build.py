"""
Phase 1-5: LangGraph graph -- Product Truth Extractor -> Concept Agent -> 5 parallel
Critic Chain checkers -> Meta-Critic -> Merge Coherence Validator -> (Copy Editor
loop-back | Meta-Critic swap retry | fallback) -> winning_script finalized ->
[Treatment Agent -> Shot-List Agent -> Budget Gate -> Video-Gen Node -> Ken-Burns
Fallback Node -> Continuity Agent -> Continuity Gate -> (retry loop back to
Video-Gen | Assembly Agent)] IN PARALLEL WITH [Voiceover + Caption Agent ->
Assembly Agent] -> END.

The full Critic Chain (§5.4) is wired end to end, including the Merge Coherence
Validator (§5.4.7) and Copy Editor (§5.4.8). `winning_script` is set by
merge_validator_node on EITHER a full pass ("finalize") or a terminal fallback
("fallback") -- both are legitimate, usable winning scripts (the fallback is
the single highest composite-scoring original variant, not a degraded/partial
result), so BOTH route into Treatment Agent rather than only "finalize". Phase 2
(Treatment Agent §5.5, Shot-List Agent §5.6, Budget Gate §5.7) and Phase 3
(Video-Gen Node §5.8, Ken-Burns Fallback Node §5.9) are wired in after it.

Phase 4 (§5.10) adds the Continuity Agent (Qwen-VL drift scoring) and the
Continuity Gate (capped retry + human-in-the-loop) after Ken-Burns, plus a
CONDITIONAL LOOP: the Gate's `route_after_continuity_gate` sends the run back to
`video_gen` whenever it reset any drifted shot to "pending" (an automatic retry,
or a human `retry_with_edit`), else to END. This is the pipeline's first real
cycle: `video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback -> continuity_agent -> continuity_gate ->
(loop back to video_gen for retrying shots | finish)`. The Gate is also where the
graph genuinely `interrupt()`s for a retry-exhausted shot -- pause/resume that
REQUIRES the checkpointer below. Unlike prior phases, Phase 4 wires itself into
this file directly: a retry loop is a graph-topology feature that can only be
exercised in the compiled graph.

Phase 5 (§5.11) adds the Voiceover + Caption Agent as a SECOND parallel branch
off `merge_validator` -- it reads only `winning_script`, not `treatment`/
`shot_list`/`generated_shots`, so it does not need to wait behind Video-Gen or
Continuity and starts the same superstep as `treatment_agent`. Wired via
`_route_after_merge_validation_with_vo` (below), which wraps the pure
`route_after_merge_validation` (kept untouched -- it is independently
unit-tested and also called internally by `merge_validator_node`) to fan out
to BOTH `treatment_agent` and `voiceover_caption_agent` on "finalize"/
"fallback", per this node's own documented wiring plan
(agents/voiceover_caption_agent.py, "HOW THIS COMPOSES WITH THE REST OF THE
GRAPH").

Phase 5 (§5.12) adds the Assembly Agent as a genuine FAN-IN JOIN of the two
branches above: `voiceover_caption_agent -> assembly_agent` and
`continuity_gate`'s conditional "end" route -> `assembly_agent` (replacing
both branches' previous independent `-> END` edges). This is a NEW topology
shape for this graph -- the prior fan-in precedent (the 5 Critic-Chain
checkers -> meta_critic) always completes every branch in the SAME superstep
(a static parallel fan-out with no loop), but here one branch
(voiceover_caption_agent) typically finishes in one early superstep while the
other (the `video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback -> continuity_agent ->
continuity_gate` retry cycle) can take an unbounded number of superstep
passes before finally routing to "end". A node with two plain (non-list)
incoming edges into the SAME per-node trigger channel fires on the FIRST
writer by default (LangGraph's `EphemeralValue` trigger semantics) -- which
would run `assembly_agent` immediately after `voiceover_caption_agent`
completes, long before the continuity loop (or a human-review interrupt
inside it) has settled, with `generated_shots`/`shot_list` still mid-flight.
`assembly_agent` is therefore registered with `defer=True` (confirmed against
the installed LangGraph 1.2.7's own `graph/state.py`: `defer=True` swaps that
per-node trigger channel from `EphemeralValue` to `LastValueAfterFinish`,
which only becomes available once the Pregel loop calls `finish()` -- i.e.
once the ENTIRE rest of the graph, including an arbitrarily-long continuity
retry loop and any interrupt/resume pause inside it, has genuinely settled
with no more work scheduled). This is verified against the REAL compiled
graph, not assumed: `tests/test_continuity_loop_e2e.py::test_assembly_agent_runs_exactly_once_after_continuity_loop_resolves`
seeds a 2-pass retry loop (voiceover finishes trivially fast, the drifty
shot's auto-retry takes a second full loop pass) and asserts `assembly_agent`
(and its `master_cut_ready` C2 event) fires EXACTLY ONCE, only after the
loop's FINAL pass resolves to "end", with the fully-final post-retry
`shot_list`/`generated_shots` and the early-finished `voiceover` both visible
to it. `assembly_agent -> END` closes the graph.

Checkpointer selection is graceful:
  - if DATABASE_URL is set  -> AsyncPostgresSaver (real durable checkpoints)
  - otherwise               -> MemorySaver  (standalone, no DB required)

AsyncPostgresSaver, not the sync PostgresSaver: the FastAPI app drives the
graph via `astream_events` (async), and the sync PostgresSaver's async
methods (aget_tuple, etc.) raise NotImplementedError -- confirmed by hitting
that exact error against the real RDS instance. AsyncPostgresSaver implements
the async checkpointer interface properly.

Do NOT import/modify graph.state's schema shape — we only consume it.

NOTE: there is no Ingest node yet, so nothing populates `product_photos` or
`brief` in state before this graph runs. Driving a real run through the
/ws/{job_id} endpoint will fail with a KeyError on `state["product_photos"]`
(then `state["brief"]`) until the job-submission-form -> ingest-endpoint ->
OSS-upload path exists (Phase 1, still open on both KR's and RR's task
lists). Use `derisk/test_truth_extractor.py` and `derisk/test_concept_agent.py`
to exercise each agent standalone until then.

    fans to `voice_direction_agent` (the head of that sub-branch) rather than
    directly to `voiceover_caption_agent`.
