C1 — LangGraph shared state schema (frozen contract, Phase 0).
Extend additively only: add new keys, never rename/remove an existing one
without a sync between KR and RR and a version bump in this docstring.
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md section 6.

version: 14
  - v14: Two architectural changes (feature/open-world-v2).
        PART 1 -- Cross-pollination merge REMOVED. The pipeline no longer
        stitches a hook from variant A + body from B + CTA from C. Instead the
        Meta-Critic (meta_critic_node) now picks the single highest-composite
        surviving ScriptVariant and writes it straight to `winning_script`
        (unchanged in shape). The Merge Coherence Validator and Copy Editor are
        unwired from the graph (graph/build.py). Four cross-pollination-only
        scratch keys are now LEGACY (no longer written/read on the live path):
        `merge_attempts`, `pending_merge_candidate`, `coherence_validation_result`,
        `last_copy_edit` -- kept in the schema (marked legacy below) rather than
        deleted so the now-unwired merge_validator/copy_editor modules and their
        unit tests still type-check.
        PART 2 -- Open-world shot types. `Shot.shot_type` and `Shot.camera_move`
        are now plain `str` (were closed `Literal` enums), mirroring
        graph/shot_schema.py v6, so the VDA/Shot-List Agent can name a shot's
        actual composition/motion in free-form phrases. Adds
        `Shot.is_human_shot: NotRequired[bool]` (default-False semantics): the
        VDA human_presence judgment carried through so downstream nodes
        (video_gen, budget_gate, assembly) read this field instead of matching
        the free-form shot_type against a frozen human-shot set.
  - v13: Product Web Research (feature/product-web-research). Adds a new
        LangGraph node (agents/product_research_node.py) that runs between
        product_truth_extractor and concept_agent and, ONLY for tech/software-
        like ("spec_driven") products, autonomously web-searches (Tavily) for
        public specs/features and distills up to 10 checkable ResearchFact
        objects. Three additive shapes, no removals:
          (a) ResearchFact TypedDict — a single web-sourced, checkable claim
              (fact_id "r1"/"r2"/..., deliberately disjoint from ProductTruth's
              "t*" ids), with category/source_url/confidence.
          (b) ProductResearch TypedDict + product_research: NotRequired[...] on
              ProductCutState — the node's whole output (performed flag,
              spec_driven/appearance_driven/skipped classification, facts, and
              the queries actually run).
          (c) ScriptVariant.grounding_research_ids: NotRequired[list[str]] — the
              "r*" ids a variant's copy/VO actually used, cited by the concept
              agent exactly like grounding_truth_ids cites "t*" ids.
        CRITICAL CONTRACT: ResearchFacts are NOT ProductTruths and never merge
        into product_truths. Truths are photo-grounded VISUAL anchors that feed
        the video/i2v prompt pipeline (Treatment/Shot-List/Video-Gen); a research
        fact ("battery lasts 2.2h") is copy/VO material only, is NOT visible in
        the photos, and MUST NEVER drive a visual prompt (doing so would let an
        unseeable spec hallucinate into the generated image). They therefore live
        in a separate state key with their own "r*" id namespace so the two can
        never be confused by any downstream consumer.
  - v2: added CompletionDetail + two CriticScore keys (completion, completion_detail)
        and six NotRequired Critic-Chain scratch keys (hook/pacing/body/cta/tone_scores,
        meta_critic_result) to plumb the 5 parallel checkers into the Meta-Critic join.
  - v3: added two NotRequired Merge Coherence Validator scratch keys (§5.4.7):
        merge_attempts (list[dict], §6-shaped: one entry per merge attempt, appended
        by merge_validator_node) and pending_merge_candidate (dict, a
        MergeCandidate.model_dump() scratch key written when repairing/setting up
        the next attempt). winning_script is unchanged in shape -- it is now only
        ever written by merge_validator_node, on a pass or the terminal fallback.
  - v4: added two NotRequired scratch keys reconciling merge_validator_node with
        agents/copy_editor.py's copy_editor_node (built in parallel, documents its
        own state assumptions in its module docstring): coherence_validation_result
        (dict, a CoherenceValidationResult.model_dump() -- written by
        merge_validator_node when routing to the Copy Editor, read by
        copy_editor_node for seam_flags/justification) and last_copy_edit (dict, a
        CopyEditResult.model_dump() -- written by copy_editor_node, read by
        merge_validator_node's next call to populate that attempt's §6 copy_edit
        sub-object and the "copy_edited_then_accepted" outcome).
  - v5: Phase 2 research (docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.6) added two
        additive enum values to Shot ahead of the Shot-List Agent build:
        camera_move += "rack_focus", shot_type += "product_in_hand". Mirrored
        in graph/shot_schema.py's runtime-validated CameraMove/ShotType (C3
        freeze, docs/BUILD_TASKS.md Phase 2). No field additions/removals.
  - v6: Phase 3 (agents/video_gen_node.py, KR) hands a shot off to the
        not-yet-built Ken-Burns Fallback Node (§5.9, RR) on a hard API
        failure/timeout/budget-exceeded by setting status to a new value and
        attaching a failure_reason -- formalizing what KR's module flagged as
        a self-invented, unvalidated "known departure" pending a KR/RR sync
        (docs/BUILD_TASKS.md Phase 3). Adds: Shot.status += "fallback_requested"
        (deliberately distinct from the existing "fallback" value, which per
        §5.9 means Ken-Burns has ALREADY rendered the clip -- "fallback_requested"
        means "handed off, not rendered yet"); new FailureReason TypedDict
        ({type: "timeout"|"api_error"|"budget_exceeded", detail: str}) and
        Shot.failure_reason: NotRequired[FailureReason]. Mirrored in
        graph/shot_schema.py's runtime-validated ShotStatus/ShotModel.
  - v7: Phase 5 wiring (agents/voiceover_caption_agent.py) made
        voiceover_caption_agent a genuine parallel branch off merge_validator's
        "finalize"/"fallback" routes, alongside treatment_agent (graph/build.py).
        Both branches used to independently read-modify-write the single
        `reasoning_trace: str` key (every agent module's shared "read current +
        append this node's note" convention) -- fine when sequential, but two
        nodes in the SAME superstep both writing a plain (LastValue) channel is
        rejected outright by LangGraph (InvalidUpdateError: "Can receive only
        one value per step"). Rather than retrofit that read-modify-write
        convention across all dozen existing agent modules (and their already-
        passing unit tests that assert on it) into a proper concurrent-safe
        reducer, voiceover_caption_agent_node was given its OWN dedicated key,
        `voiceover_reasoning_trace` -- a single-writer channel, so no reducer is
        needed and every other node's existing contract/tests are untouched.
        Additive only; `reasoning_trace` is unchanged in shape and still the
        trace for the treatment_agent-and-onward chain.
  - v8: Video-gen fidelity fix (root cause: a Meta Quest VR headset's photos
        produced a generated clip showing "a phone on a phone stand" --
        completely the wrong object). Two additive changes, both used only by
        agents/product_truth_extractor.py, agents/video_gen_node.py,
        agents/continuity_agent.py and agents/continuity_gate.py -- no
        existing field renamed/removed:
          (a) ProductTruth.category += "form_factor" -- exactly one fact per
              job, a single holistic whole-object shape/silhouette/size
              anchor sentence synthesized across ALL product photos, distinct
              from every other category (which are each one isolated
              micro-fact). Root cause: an i2v prompt built from only a single
              isolated micro-fact ("matte-black textured strap") under-
              specifies the subject as a WHOLE object, and i2v models suffer
              documented "identity drift" where an ambiguous subject resolves
              toward a common training-data composition ("phone on a stand")
              instead of the actual, rarer product shape. Consumed by
              video_gen_node.py's Subject line construction, which now leads
              with this anchor before the per-shot micro-fact.
          (b) GeneratedShot.identity_check: NotRequired[IdentityCheck] -- a
              CATEGORICAL "is this even the same physical object class"
              verdict from a SEPARATE Qwen-VL call on an early frame of the
              generated clip (agents/continuity_agent.py's new frame-0(ish)
              identity check). Additive alongside the existing continuous
              `drift_score` -- a different question on a different scale, not
              a stricter threshold on the same one. Consumed by
              agents/continuity_gate.py for a hard-identity-failure routing
              path (one automatic re-sample, then straight to the Ken-Burns
              fallback on a second consecutive failure) distinct from the
              existing drift-retry/human-review path.
  - v9: Video-gen creative-direction fix (video-gen-fidelity branch, RR) added
        one additive enum value to Shot ahead of a Shot-List Agent/Video-Gen
        Node prompt-phrasing rework: shot_type += "worn_in_use" (product worn/
        carried/operated by a visible person at medium-to-wide framing, person
        moves, product rides along) -- distinct from the existing
        "lifestyle_context" (now strictly a NO-human styled scene, resolving a
        prior dual-meaning overload) and "product_in_hand" (a static/close
        hand-contact composition). Mirrored in graph/shot_schema.py's
        runtime-validated ShotType (C3 v4). No field additions/removals.
  - v10: Story-arc/character-consistency fix (video-gen-fidelity branch).
        Adds ONE additive field: Treatment.character_anchor: NotRequired[str].
        Root cause: text-only i2v prompting cannot lock FACIAL identity across
        independent Wan generations (no video-to-video chaining, no seed
        guarantee -- confirmed against Alibaba's own docs), so a script
        implying a recurring person with no anchored physical description let
        each human-interaction shot's Call B independently invent hair/
        wardrobe/setting, producing a different-looking "different person" in
        every shot rather than one consistent story. `character_anchor` is
        ONE sentence, produced by the Treatment Agent (not Concept Agent --
        Concept Agent still produces 4 competing variants pre-selection, so
        synthesizing a character per variant would be wasted work; Treatment
        Agent already runs once on the winning script and already owns other
        whole-ad global fields of identical shape) ONLY when the winning
        script's STORY/REAL-WORLD-USE beat actually implies a person -- never
        forced. Gives hair color/length/texture, one distinctively-colored
        wardrobe item, an age band, and a named setting with 1-2 fixed
        landmarks + time-of-day, drawn from the same palette as `color_story`
        so human shots and product-alone shots visually cohere. Consumed by
        agents/video_gen_node.py's new verbatim, never-cut `Cast:` prompt
        section on every human-interaction shot (see that module's docstring).
        NotRequired + empty-string-safe: a script with no implied person
        (or a Treatment Agent fallback) simply omits/blanks it, and
        video_gen_node.py's Cast section renders nothing in that case.
  - v11: Visual Direction Agent: adds BeatVisualDirection + VisualDirection TypedDicts
        and visual_direction: NotRequired[VisualDirection] to ProductCutState.
        ProductTruth.category: "imperfection" → "material_character".
  - v12: Voice Direction Agent (agents/voice_direction_agent.py): adds DirectedBeat
        TypedDict and directed_script_beats: NotRequired[list[DirectedBeat]] to
        ProductCutState. Each DirectedBeat carries spoken_text (a natural spoken
        English rewrite of the raw ScriptBeat.line) plus emotion + pacing metadata
        used by voiceover_caption_agent to build CosyVoice instruction + speech_rate per beat.
        Written by voice_direction_agent_node (runs as a serial pre-step before
        voiceover_caption_agent), read by voiceover_caption_agent_node in preference
        to raw winning_script.beats.
