Video-Gen Node — orchestration around Wan2.6-i2v-us (Phase 3).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.8. Ken-Burns Fallback Node
(§5.9) is RR's separate Phase 3 task (agents/ken_burns_fallback_node.py, now
built and wired) -- see the INTERFACE section below for the hand-off this
module assumes.

Confirmed against the ACTUAL merged code before writing anything (per this
task's own instruction not to assume field names from docs):
  * `graph.state.Shot` / `graph.shot_schema.ShotModel` (C1/C3, frozen) --
    fields used here: shot_id, beat_role, description, shot_type, camera_move,
    framing, lighting, negative_prompt, reference_image_id, text_overlay_zone,
    duration_sec, allocated_budget, voiceover_line, justification
    ({script_quote, truth_fact_id, treatment_ref}), status, retry_count.
  * `graph.state.GeneratedShot` (C1, frozen): {video_uri, drift_score
    (NotRequired, set later by Continuity), attempt}.
  * `agents.shot_list_agent`: MIN_SHOT_DURATION_SEC/MAX_SHOT_DURATION_SEC (3-5s
    per shot), NEGATIVE_PROMPT_BOILERPLATE already baked into every shot's own
    `negative_prompt` field -- reused here, not rebuilt (see requirement 3 note
    below).
  * `agents.budget_gate`: RATE_720P/RATE_1080P ($/sec Wan pricing) and its own
    documented expectation ("A future Video-Gen Node derives resolution/retry
    affordability by comparing allocated_budget against duration_sec ×
    RATE_1080P, not by reading a categorical field") -- this module is that
    future node; the budget-clamp policy below is that comparison, made real.
  * `.env.example`: MODEL_VIDEO=wan2.6-i2v-us (image-to-video only, confirmed;
    never falls back to text-to-video -- img_url is always supplied).

PROMPT-CONSTRUCTION MAPPING (requirement 2; §5.8's formula is "Subject →
Action/Motion → Camera → Lighting → Composition → Mood → Quality"). Each
section is built from a real, already-typed field -- nothing is re-derived
from free text except where noted:
  * Subject      <- the shot's cited product_truths[] fact (justification.
                    truth_fact_id lookup). A concrete factual anchor, not an
                    invented product name (ProductCutState has no product-name
                    field at all -- only brief/product_photos).
  * Cast          <- treatment.character_anchor VERBATIM (video-gen-fidelity
                    story-arc fix, graph/state.py Treatment v10) -- ONLY on
                    human-interaction shots (shot_type product_in_hand /
                    worn_in_use), ONLY when the treatment actually carries one
                    (a script implying no person never gets a fabricated Cast
                    section). Placed immediately after Subject, before
                    Action/Motion -- never paraphrased, never trimmed by the
                    char-budget cutter below (same never-cut status as
                    _IDENTITY_PROTECTION_CLAUSE). Funded without raising the
                    overall PROMPT_CHAR_BUDGET: Quality is dropped and Mood is
                    compressed UNCONDITIONALLY on every human-interaction
                    shot (not just as the overflow fallback) -- see
                    `_build_prompt`'s own comments for the exact mechanism.
  * Action/Motion <- shot.description VERBATIM. The Shot-List Agent (§5.6 Call
                    B) already wrote this as the shot's 80-120 word action/
                    motion narrative, itself grounded in the same cited fact
                    and reasoned through the camera-affordance rubric --
                    rebuilding it from scratch here would just be a worse
                    rewrite of already-grounded, already-validated content.
  * Camera        <- shot.camera_move (push_in/orbit/static/pan/tilt_up/
                    pull_back/rack_focus -- the v2 C3 addition, handled
                    generically since it's just another enum value here).
  * Lighting      <- shot.lighting (the one shared lighting/style string
                    reused across every shot in the job, per C1).
  * Composition   <- shot.shot_type (hook_hero/macro_detail/lifestyle_context/
                    hero_reframe/cta_endcard/product_in_hand/worn_in_use --
                    product_in_hand is the v2 C3 addition, worn_in_use the v4
                    C3 addition) + shot.framing + a text_overlay_zone
                    reservation note. When shot_type is "product_in_hand" or
                    "worn_in_use" (the human-interaction compositions), an
                    explicit POSITIVE continuity clause is appended ("natural
                    hand interaction with five anatomically correct fingers...
                    product stays centered, no scene cut", extended with a
                    scale-lock and an occlusion-continuity clause) -- per
                    docs/DERISK_VIDEO_GEN_RESULT.md §6, this positive
                    instruction (not the negative prompt alone) is what
                    empirically stopped the product-vanishing failure mode
                    during human-interaction shots in the real de-risk test.
  * Mood          <- treatment.director_persona + treatment.pacing_philosophy
                    (the whole ad's directorial voice, applied per shot).
  * Quality       <- a fixed quality/fidelity boilerplate clause (this is
                    genuinely generic across every shot in every job -- unlike
                    every other section, there is no real per-shot/per-product
                    field this could be grounded in).

NEGATIVE PROMPT (requirement 3). Reused verbatim from `shot.negative_prompt`
-- the Shot-List Agent already built this (its own
NEGATIVE_PROMPT_BOILERPLATE, identity-first ordering, plus any per-shot
extra risk terms) covering exactly the guardrail list requirement 3 asks
for (morphing/melting, flickering, deformed hands/fused fingers, warped
product shape, text/logo distortion). Rebuilding a second copy here would
risk the two silently drifting apart; passed straight through to the
DashScope call's own `negative_prompt` parameter (a first-class, separate
parameter from `prompt` in the native SDK -- not string-concatenated).

BUDGET CLAMP (requirement 5, `_resolve_generation_params`). Per
agents/budget_gate.py's own documented contract: compare `allocated_budget`
against `duration_sec x RATE_1080P` / `x RATE_720P`.
  * allocated_budget >= 1080p cost  -> generate at full duration_sec, 1080p.
  * allocated_budget >= 720p cost   -> generate at full duration_sec, 720p
                                       (resolution clamped, duration untouched).
  * otherwise                       -> clamp DURATION down to what
                                       allocated_budget affords at 720p (the
                                       cheapest rate). If even
                                       MIN_SHOT_DURATION_SEC at 720p doesn't
                                       fit (can genuinely happen: the Budget
                                       Gate's §5.7 floor case sets EVERY
                                       shot's allocated_budget to a flat
                                       FLOOR_COST regardless of that shot's
                                       own duration_sec when the cap can't fit
                                       even at floor), the shot is handed off
                                       as a "budget_exceeded" failure WITHOUT
                                       ever calling the video-gen API --
                                       nothing is spent generating something
                                       that structurally cannot be afforded.
The realized resolution/duration and whether a clamp occurred are recorded on
the *GeneratedShot* entry (resolution_used/duration_sec_used/budget_clamped),
not on the Shot itself -- see "KNOWN DEPARTURES" below for why.

PARALLEL FAN-OUT (requirement 1) -- SELF-CONTAINED, NO C1 CHANGE NEEDED. This
module builds and runs its OWN small internal LangGraph StateGraph (dispatch
-> Send() one branch per shot -> per-shot node -> join) inside
`generate_videos()`, entirely private to this module. Two accumulator fields
in that INTERNAL graph's own state type (`_VideoGenGraphState`,
`generated_shots` / `failures`) use `Annotated[..., reducer]` so N parallel
branches merge instead of colliding -- this is required (LangGraph raises
InvalidUpdateError if two branches in the same superstep write the same
un-reduced key), but it is entirely private to this module's internal
subgraph. The OUTER `graph.state.ProductCutState` is NEVER touched: from the
outer graph's point of view (once this is wired in), `video_gen_node` is one
ordinary node that happens to parallelize its own work internally and returns
ONE consolidated update, exactly as if it had used `asyncio.gather` -- no
reducer annotation needed on the frozen `ProductCutState.generated_shots`
field. `Send()` is genuinely exercised (verified by the graph-level test in
test_video_gen_node.py), it is just not the OUTER pipeline graph.

WIRED INTO graph/build.py -- this section previously said "NOT WIRED... YET"
even after the wiring commit landed (a stale claim, corrected here; the
file's own later "PHASE 4" section below already contradicted it, saying
"When this node was wired into graph/build.py..."). Real status:
`budget_gate -> video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback -> continuity_agent ->
continuity_gate`, with a conditional loop back to `video_gen` for retries
(Phase 4). Historical note, for context: this was originally left unwired as
a deliberate scope boundary (every prior phase's agents were built+merged
standalone first, then wired into graph/build.py as a separate, later
integration commit, matching this codebase's established rhythm) -- that
follow-up step has since happened.

RESOLVED -- native DashScope SDK region/base-URL configuration (previously a
KNOWN GAP, confirmed live during the BUILD_TASKS.md audit's de-risk pass).
docs/DERISK_VIDEO_GEN_RESULT.md §5 found that the native `dashscope` SDK (not
the OpenAI-compatible client every other agent in this codebase uses) needs
the *native* API base (`.../api/v1`, region-scoped to `dashscope-us` for this
account), a DIFFERENT path than `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL` (.env.example's
documented OpenAI-*compatible* base for chat/vision). This module sets
`dashscope.api_key` from `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and, if present,
`dashscope.base_http_api_url` from an optional `DASHSCOPE_VIDEO_BASE_URL` env
var. CONFIRMED live: setting `DASHSCOPE_VIDEO_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-us.aliyuncs.com/api/v1`
(same host as `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL`, native `/api/v1` path instead of
`/compatible-mode/v1`) against the real account produced two real,
ffprobe-verified Wan2.6-i2v-us clips (latency 41.7s/92.3s, both within the
originally documented 42-99s range). `backend/derisk/test_video_gen.py` (the
reproduction script this KNOWN GAP note said was never committed) now exists
and was used to produce this confirmation.

SCHEMA STATUS -- RESOLVED (Phase 3 KR/RR sync). Items 1-2 below were originally
flagged as self-invented, unconfirmed departures from the frozen schemas,
pending a sync with RR before the Ken-Burns Fallback Node got built against
them. That sync happened: RR formalized both into C1/C2/C3 (graph/state.py v6,
graph/shot_schema.py v3, graph/events.py v3) rather than changing the shape --
this module's runtime behavior is unchanged, the schemas simply now declare
what this module already produced. Item 3 remains a deliberate, permanent
design choice (not something pending resolution):
  1. `status = "fallback_requested"` is now a real value in
     `graph.state.Shot.status`'s Literal, `graph.shot_schema.ShotModel`'s
     `ShotStatus`, and `graph.events.ShotGeneratedPayload.status`'s Literal.
     Still deliberately distinct from the existing "fallback" value: per §5.9,
     "fallback" is what the Ken-Burns node (agents/ken_burns_fallback_node.py,
     now built and wired) sets once it has actually produced the pan/zoom
     clip -- "fallback_requested" means "handed off, Ken-Burns hasn't run yet."
  2. `failure_reason: {type, detail}` is now a declared, optional field on
     `graph.shot_schema.ShotModel` (`Optional[FailureReasonModel] = None`) and
     `graph.state.Shot` (`NotRequired[FailureReason]`) -- a shot carrying it no
     longer risks failing a future re-validation pass through that Pydantic
     model (`extra="forbid"` no longer applies to this field).
  3. `resolution_used` / `duration_sec_used` / `budget_clamped` are extra keys
     on the *GeneratedShot* dict beyond its frozen `{video_uri, drift_score,
     attempt}` shape (requirement 5's "record that clamp in the shot's
     state"). Chosen deliberately over extending Shot itself: unlike Shot,
     GeneratedShot has no Pydantic/`extra="forbid"` validator anywhere in this
     codebase, so this costs nothing today.
  4. Event dispatch (`shot_generated` per C2, graph/events.py) IS now wired up
     in the node wrapper (Phase 3 RR task 2): one `shot_generated` event per
     REAL clip (`is_fallback=False`); handed-off shots get their
     `is_fallback=True` event from the Ken-Burns node once it renders them. Real
     clips are also copied from the provider's ephemeral URL into OSS here (§5.8
     "clip persisted to OSS"). See `video_gen_node` below.

INTERFACE FOR KEN-BURNS FALLBACK NODE (not yet built -- RR). CONFIRMED, per
the Phase 3 KR/RR sync above -- this shape is now the real, formalized C1/C3
contract, not an assumption pending agreement:
  * Watch for `shot["status"] == "fallback_requested"` on any shot in
    `state["shot_list"]` this node returns.
  * That shot will have `shot["failure_reason"] = {"type": "timeout" |
    "api_error" | "budget_exceeded", "detail": "<human-readable string>"}`.
  * `shot["retry_count"]` is GUARANTEED untouched on this path -- this module
    never reads or writes that key anywhere (grep confirms: the only per-shot
    output keys this module ever returns are `status`, `failure_reason`, and
    the entries under `generated_shots`). The retry budget stays reserved for
    the Continuity Agent's quality-driven retries (§5.10), never consumed by
    an infrastructure failure, per §5.8's own explicit requirement.
  * No `generated_shots[shot_id]` entry is written for a handed-off shot --
    there is no video to reference yet. Ken-Burns should write that entry
    itself once its own pan/zoom clip exists.

PHASE 4 (Continuity retry loop -- two small, surgical production changes here).
When this node was wired into graph/build.py it ran exactly once per job. Phase 4
adds a Continuity retry cycle (agents/continuity_gate.py:
`... -> continuity_gate -> [loop back to video_gen if any shot is now "pending"]`),
which means this node can now run MORE than once, and the second pass must NOT
blindly regenerate every shot. Two minimal changes make it loop-safe:
  A. `_dispatch` now fans out `Send()` ONLY for shots whose `status == "pending"`
     (the value shots arrive with, and the value the Continuity Gate resets a
     retrying shot to). Every other shot ("passed"/"fallback"/"fallback_requested"
     /"review") is passed through unchanged by `_join`'s existing else-branch --
     the same "pass through non-matching shots untouched" posture
     ken_burns_fallback_node uses. Without this, a retry loop would re-hit the Wan
     API (real money) for shots that already passed.
  B. The node wrapper now MERGES its new GeneratedShot entries INTO the incoming
     `state["generated_shots"]` instead of returning only the newly-generated
     ones. `generated_shots` is an overwrite-semantics field; on a retry pass
     `generate_videos` only produces entries for the one(s) being regenerated, so
     returning just those would clobber every already-generated shot's entry.
     Merging preserves them (mirrors ken_burns_fallback_node). First-pass state
     has no entries, so this is a no-op there and existing tests are unaffected.
