"""
Assembly Agent -- stitches shot clips + voiceover + captions into one master
cut (Phase 5). Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.12.

Confirmed against the ACTUAL merged code before writing anything:
  * `graph.state.Shot.justification.treatment_ref` matches
    `Treatment.beat_treatments[].beat_index`, which matches the winning
    script beat's own position -- the ONLY reliable way to map a `Shot` back
    to "which script beat is this" (shot_list is NOT guaranteed positional
    after `agents/budget_gate.py` cuts a shot).
  * `agents/budget_gate.py` can and does drop a shot entirely (cut-only,
    never merge -- see that module's own docstring), so
    `len(shot_list) <= len(winning_script.beats)` is a real, common case, not
    a defensive-only edge.
  * `agents/voiceover_caption_agent.py` produces ONE caption entry per
    `winning_script.beats` element, unconditionally, with `start_ts`/`end_ts`
    cumulative from REAL measured TTS clip durations -- it has no idea what
    Budget Gate did to the shot list. The caption track is therefore the
    complete, authoritative timeline; the shot list is a partial visual
    covering of it.
  * `agents/ken_burns_fallback_node.py` fallback clips are hardcoded
    1920x1080 @ 30fps; real Wan clips can independently land at 720p or
    1080p AND can be portrait (a real generation this session measured
    784x1174) -- a single job's shots are routinely a resolution/orientation
    mix, so every segment is normalized (scale+letterbox, never a bare
    scale-to-fill) onto one shared canvas before concatenation.
  * `GeneratedShot.duration_sec_used` is the PLANNED duration on both the
    real and fallback paths (`ken_burns_fallback_node.py` sets it to
    `shot["duration_sec"]` verbatim; a live pipeline run this session showed
    Wan clips landing at 3.01s measured against a 3.0/4.0s planned value) --
    never trusted here; every downloaded clip is `ffmpeg.probe`d for its
    real duration/resolution.
  * `agents._oss._download_to_temp` / `_put_and_sign` / `oss_job_asset_key`
    are reused verbatim (no second hand-rolled download/upload path) --
    `upload_master_cut_to_oss` is the one small additive wrapper this task
    needed there, mirroring `upload_audio_to_oss`/`upload_json_to_oss`.

TWO-STAGE FFMPEG PIPELINE (ffmpeg 8.1.2-full_build-www.gyan.dev, confirmed on
this machine; a real end-to-end prototype was run against it -- concat
demuxer of video-only segments + chained `drawtext` + external audio input +
`apad`/`-shortest` -- before any of this was written, so the filter graph
below is empirically verified, not merely researched).

STAGE 1 (one ffmpeg run PER SHOT): download the clip, probe its REAL
duration/resolution, normalize it onto the job's shared canvas
(`scale ... force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad,setsar=1`), force true
CFR at `FPS` (`fps=30` -- this, not a bare copy, is what prevents a
stutter/desync at a Wan<->Ken-Burns cut, since Ken-Burns is native CFR30 and
Wan's realized fps is never assumed), strip all audio (`-an` -- every clip's
baked-in audio is Wan's own incidental ambient noise or Ken-Burns's literal
silence, never meaningful, never mixed into the final ad), and conform the
VIDEO's duration to its beat's REAL measured VO window (never the other way
around -- see DURATION CONFORMING below). Written to a small, fast
(`-preset veryfast`) intermediate file; it gets re-encoded once more in
Stage 2 anyway.

STAGE 2 (one ffmpeg run): concat-DEMUX (not concat-filter -- safe specifically
BECAUSE Stage 1 already normalized every segment to identical codec/size/fps/
pix_fmt/no-audio) the Stage-1 segments in beat order, burn every beat's
caption via a `drawtext` chain gated with `enable=between(t,start_ts,end_ts)`
straight off the REAL captions JSON, map the downloaded VO audio file as the
SOLE audio track (`apad` + `-shortest` absorbs sub-frame rounding drift
rather than truncating a video frame or leaving a dangling silent tail), and
encode the final mezzanine (`-crf 16 -preset slow` -- this is NOT the final
per-aspect-ratio deliverable; a later, not-yet-built Format Export node
re-encodes it again, so this pass avoids stacking a second lossy compression
on top of Wan's already-compressed output).

DURATION CONFORMING -- THE CORE DESIGN DECISION. The voiceover is the master
clock and is NEVER time-stretched: its captions' timestamps are cumulative
offsets baked into ONE already-concatenated audio file (§5.11), so stretching
any beat's audio would desync every subsequent beat's caption. Instead each
shot's VIDEO is conformed to its own beat's real VO window
(`target = caption.end_ts - caption.start_ts`):
  * `actual >= target`            -> trim (`trim=duration=target`).
  * `(target-actual)/actual<=15%` -> imperceptible speed-up (`setpts`).
  * otherwise                     -> freeze-frame pad (`tpad stop_mode=clone`).
Once every segment is conformed to its own beat's real VO duration, the
concatenated video timeline becomes IDENTICAL to the VO/caption timeline, so
Stage 2's `enable=between(...)` gating just works directly off the real
captions JSON -- no separate caption-alignment pass is needed.

BEAT/SHOT MISMATCH POLICY (a real gap nothing upstream has addressed --
Budget Gate can and does cut a shot, but the captions cover every beat
regardless). CHOSEN: HOLD a neighboring shot's frame across the orphaned
beat's VO window (extend the PRECEDING shot's last frame if one exists,
else the FOLLOWING shot's first frame for a leading gap) -- never drop the
VO audio or its caption for that beat. Rejected alternative: cut the
orphaned beat's audio out of the concatenated VO track. Why HOLD wins:
  1. It never touches the VO audio a second time. The whole point of
     "duration conforming" above is that the VO's baked-in cumulative
     timestamps are sacrosanct once synthesized; cutting a slice out would
     require re-deriving every LATER beat's caption timing to shift back by
     the removed span -- reintroducing exactly the kind of derived-timing
     drift the real-measured-duration design elsewhere in this pipeline
     exists to avoid.
  2. Per `agents/budget_gate.py`'s own docstring, a cut shot is
     DETERMINISTICALLY the single LOWEST-WEIGHT shot in the job -- by
     construction never the hook/cta/top-proof shot. The beat losing its
     dedicated clip is therefore the least narratively-critical one; a held
     frame across that one beat's window is a materially smaller quality hit
     than silently deleting a line of ad copy the seller's script (and the
     already-synthesized VO) actually contains.
  3. Precedent: `agents/ken_burns_fallback_node.py` already treats "a
     visibly frozen/broken-looking frame" as a real defect worth engineering
     around (its faintest zoom is applied even to a `static` camera move for
     exactly this reason). The HOLD mechanism here reuses the same
     `tpad stop_mode=clone`/`start_mode=clone` primitive Stage 1 already uses
     for a normal freeze-pad conform, so an orphaned beat is rendered with
     the identical "extend a real frame" technique as a beat whose own real
     clip just happened to be shorter than its VO window -- not a special
     second code path.
A shot's clip that fails to DOWNLOAD (network/OSS error) is treated by the
exact same mechanism -- see `assemble_master_cut`'s per-shot try/except: one
shot's fetch failure degrades that beat to a held-frame gap (logged, traced,
never crashes the whole assembly), mirroring `video_gen_node.py`'s per-shot
failure isolation posture. `test_assembly_agent.py::test_shot_download_failure_is_isolated_as_a_held_frame_gap`
locks this in.

CANVAS SELECTION. Computed once per job from the REAL (ffprobe'd, never
`resolution_used`) dimensions of every `status=="passed"` (real Wan, not
Ken-Burns) clip -- the largest-area one wins, rounded down to even via
`force_divisible_by=2`. If every usable shot in the job is a Ken-Burns
fallback, 1920x1080 is used (§5.9's own fixed fallback spec).

CAPTION TEXT ZONE. `Shot.text_overlay_zone == "none"` (or no shot at all, for
an orphaned/held beat) falls back to `lower_third` rather than skipping the
caption -- most short-form ad video autoplays muted, so an unburned caption
is a functionally DROPPED line of ad copy, not a cosmetic omission.

PUBLIC SIGNATURE NOTE. `assemble_master_cut` returns only the master-cut URI
(per this task's own requested signature). The node wrapper needs a little
more (shot_count / total_duration_sec for the `master_cut_ready` C2 event) --
rather than widen the public contract, `assemble_master_cut` is a thin
wrapper around `_assemble_master_cut_impl`, which returns the richer
`AssemblyResult`; the node wrapper calls the richer function directly. Tests
of the "pure" logic call the public function per this task's spec; the
richer function is exercised by the node-wrapper tests.

video-gen-fidelity PHASE 3 -- CTA/ending fix (a real, independently confirmed
bug, distinct from the prompt-fidelity fix in video_gen_node.py/
shot_list_agent.py on the same branch). Confirmed root cause: the ad's final
shot's own natural motion (lift -> swing -> SETTLE) was being hard-trimmed
right at its beat's measured VO-window boundary -- e.g. a real 4.0s clip
conformed down to a 3.0s VO window, cutting off exactly the moment the clip
would be settling/resolving, with zero fade anywhere in the master cut. Two
changes, both scoped to ONLY the LAST rendered segment (the one that ends the
master cut) and ONLY the trim-direction default for mid-ad human-interaction
shots elsewhere:
  1. The LAST segment's own duration-conform NEVER hard-trims its tail
     anymore (`_ConformPlan("keep", ...)`, new mode). If it overruns its VO
     window, its full natural length is kept; Stage 2's existing `apad` +
     `-shortest` combo (already in the pipeline for absorbing sub-frame
     rounding drift) transparently extends the VO audio with trailing silence
     to match a LONGER video too -- `apad` with no explicit pad length pads
     indefinitely, and `-shortest` then just stops the output at whichever
     stream is actually longer, which is now the video. No new audio-side
     code needed for that half. If it's short, the freeze-frame hold is used
     unconditionally (never the imperceptible stretch) -- a barely-perceptible
     speed-up is the wrong trade specifically at the one moment the ad should
     feel most settled, not merely "not stretched too far."
  2. A `TAIL_SILENCE_SEC` (1.0 s) freeze-frame hold is appended to the last
     segment AFTER its caption window closes, so the viewer's ear finishes the
     last spoken word before the fade begins. Without this, the fade started
     right at the word boundary and audibly clipped the final syllable. Then a
     short fade-out (`AUDIO_FADE_SEC`/`VIDEO_FADE_SEC`) is burned into the
     very end of the master cut in Stage 2, so the ad resolves cleanly: last
     word → 0.5 s of held frame → 0.5 s video fade. Fade placement is computed
     from the REAL summed duration of the rendered Stage-1 segments (each
     segment's own render function returns the exact duration it produced),
     not `target`, so it lands correctly even when "keep" mode or the tail pad
     made the last segment longer than originally planned.
  3. Separately (not the ending fix, but the same "which end of a clip is
     weakest" question): for `product_in_hand`/`worn_in_use` MID-ad shots
     specifically, a `trim`-mode conform now prefers cutting from the START
     of the clip, not the end -- i2v models' documented bias toward
     under-motion early in a clip (the rendered motion "leaks" from the
     static reference image and only departs from it over time -- NeurIPS
     2024 "Conditional Image Leakage in I2V Diffusion," arXiv:2406.15735)
     means the clip's own weakest, least-in-motion frames are its opening
     ones; entering the segment mid-motion (standard "enter late" editing
     practice) discards exactly that weak opening instead of the clip's own
     natural end. The hook shot and static product-alone shot types keep the
     original end-trim default -- a hook needs its opening frame intact for
     attention-grabbing, and a static product-alone shot's identity fidelity
     is strongest closest to the reference photo, i.e. in its own opening
     frames.

    `master_cut_ready` event (graph/events.py v5).

    NOT a parallel-branch race like `voiceover_caption_agent_node` was (v7
    changelog, graph/state.py) -- by the time this runs, BOTH its upstream
    branches (voiceover_caption_agent, and the continuity retry loop via
    `continuity_gate`'s "end" route) have already joined (see graph/build.py's
    `defer=True` on this node -- LangGraph's `LastValueAfterFinish`/deferred-
    node mechanism, verified against a real compiled-graph test in
    tests/test_continuity_loop_e2e.py). It is therefore a single, sequential
    writer at this point in the graph and safely uses the normal shared
    `reasoning_trace` read-modify-write pattern every other (non-parallel)
    node in this codebase uses.

    `state["winning_script"]`/`state["voiceover"]` are accessed directly
    (KeyError, not `.get(...)`) -- by the time this node can possibly run,
    both are guaranteed to exist (this node's own graph position is
    downstream of both producers); a KeyError here means a wiring bug, not a
