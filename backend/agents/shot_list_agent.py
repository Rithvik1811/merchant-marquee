"""
Shot-List Agent — Qwen via DashScope (Phase 2).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.6.

Converts the winning script + the Treatment Agent's document into a
camera-literate shot list of 3-7 fully-specified `graph.state.Shot` briefs for
the Video-Gen Node. Its whole reason for existing (§2.4) is that this is where
genericness is *structurally blocked* rather than merely discouraged.

TWO SEQUENTIAL QWEN CALLS, not one (Phase 2 research decision, §5.6). The
original single-call design ordered `justification` before the camera fields on
the theory that key-emission order alone would force citation-before-composition.
That guarantee only holds under OpenAI's strict `json_schema` grammar mode;
DashScope's plain `json_object` mode does not grammar-force key order, so on Qwen
the ordering benefit is merely probabilistic. We therefore split the agent:

  * Call A — "Justify" (low temperature, extraction): produces ONLY
    `[{shot_id, beat_role, script_quote, truth_fact_id, treatment_ref}]` per
    shot. Sources are presented to the model as numbered/ID'd menus (script beats
    as a numbered list of exact quotable lines, product_truths as an id->fact
    table, treatment.beat_treatments as a beat_index->visual_approach table), so
    the model can only *select* real quotes/IDs, not invent them.
  * Justification Validator runs on Call A's output BEFORE Call B ever runs
    (see `validate_justifications` below).
  * Call B — "Realize" (warmer, grounded-creative): given each shot's now-
    VALIDATED justification, produces the camera/composition fields. Because the
    justification is a validated fact in the prompt rather than a hoped-for
    token-order effect, each camera choice is provably conditioned on a real
    quote + real truth, not merely correlated with one.

This is the same "validate the small thing, then build on it" shape already used
by the Body-Checker (deterministic pre-pass before its LLM ruling) and the Merge
Coherence Validator (pacing re-check before its blind coherence read) — and
re-prompting a Call A failure re-runs only the tiny justification object, not the
whole shot list, so it converges faster and cheaper.

JUSTIFICATION VALIDATOR OWNERSHIP. KR's real, production Justification Validator
(`agents.justification_validator.validate_justifications`, shared with Treatment
Agent) is now WIRED IN as this module's default -- the swap flagged as a one-line
change below has happened. `_default_validate_justifications` in THIS file is
RR's LOCAL STAND-IN, kept (not deleted) because it's still directly unit-tested
by this file's own test suite as a reference implementation of the same contract,
and remains available via the `validate_justifications` injection point for
anyone testing this module without KR's dependency. It is NOT the active default
anymore and is NOT a claim of ownership over KR's task.

Confirmed compatible on integration: KR's `validate_justifications` takes the
identical positional signature `(justifications, winning_script, product_truths,
treatment)` this module always called with. The one real difference is the result
key -- KR's `ValidationResult` uses `shot_id_or_beat_index` (shared with Treatment
Agent's beat validation), not this module's own stand-in's `shot_id` -- so
`_build_call_a_reprompt` below reads either key (see its docstring). No other
code path in this module reads a validator result's identifier field.

ANTI-GENERICNESS. There is deliberately no `product_category` field anywhere in
the Shot contract (a category field is the seam a lookup-table shortcut would
re-enter through). This module NEVER emits such a field and NEVER lets the model
justify a choice by "category" — the word is banned from generated content, and
`graph.shot_schema.validate_shot_list` (extra="forbid") mechanically rejects any
shot that smuggles one in.

Scope note — what this is NOT (identical posture to body_checker.py):
  * NOT wired into the live LangGraph graph (backend/graph/build.py). The
    Treatment Agent that produces `treatment` (KR's task) does not exist in the
    graph yet, so this is a standalone, independently-callable/testable function.
  * NOT the Budget Gate (§5.7). `allocated_budget` is emitted as an explicit
    0.0 placeholder here; the Budget Gate node (a separate, not-yet-built task)
    computes and overwrites the real grounding-weighted allocation. See the
    comment at the assembly site — 0.0 here is a placeholder, never a real cap.
  * NOT the Justification Validator itself (KR) — see the ownership note above.
