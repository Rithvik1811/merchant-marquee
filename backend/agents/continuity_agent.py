"""
Continuity Agent -- Qwen-VL drift scoring (Phase 4).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.10.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Guard visual fidelity of every REAL generated clip. For each
`status == "passed"` shot it extracts one representative frame from the generated
clip and, in ONE Qwen-VL call, compares it against (a) the shot's source
reference photo -- product-identity drift (color/shape/label) -- and (b) the
shot's shared `lighting`/style string -- cross-shot style consistency (§5.10's
two checks). The result is a single continuous `drift_score` written onto
`generated_shots[shot_id]`.

DRIFT SCALE (documented, single source of truth). `drift_score` is a float in
[0.0, 1.0] where:
  * 0.0  = the generated frame is a perfect identity/style match to the reference.
  * 1.0  = a totally different product or style (worst case).
The pass/fail line is `DRIFT_THRESHOLD` (default 0.35, env-overridable via
CONTINUITY_DRIFT_THRESHOLD, same "tunable constant, flag-don't-hardcode-forever"
pattern as agents/budget_gate.py's DEFAULT_JOB_BUDGET_CAP). "lower is more
similar" -- a shot PASSES when `drift_score <= DRIFT_THRESHOLD`. This constant
lives HERE (the scorer owns the scale) and is imported by the Continuity Gate
(agents/continuity_gate.py) so the score, the emitted `drift_scored` event, and
the retry/review decision all read ONE definition rather than two that could
drift apart.

WHY SCORE ONLY "passed" SHOTS. This mirrors ken_burns_fallback_node.py's own
status-filtering shape:
  * `status == "passed"` -> a real Wan-generated clip. Score it.
  * `status == "fallback"` -> a Ken-Burns pan/zoom over the SAME reference photo
    it would be compared against; drift is definitionally near-zero and not a
    meaningful check, so SKIP.
  * `status == "fallback_requested"` -> handed off, broken, no clip yet; nothing
    to score, SKIP.
  * anything else (pending/generating/review) -> not a finished real clip, SKIP.

WHY SCORE ONLY UN-SCORED CLIPS (retry-loop efficiency). A passed shot whose
GeneratedShot entry ALREADY carries a `drift_score` is skipped. On a Continuity
retry loop (Gate resets a drifted shot to "pending" -> Video-Gen regenerates
ONLY that shot and writes a FRESH GeneratedShot entry with no `drift_score` ->
back here), this means we re-score exactly the freshly-(re)generated clip and
leave every already-scored, unchanged clip alone -- no redundant Qwen-VL calls
and no duplicate `drift_scored` events for shots that didn't change. On the
first pass, no entry has a score yet, so every passed shot is scored.

SEPARATION OF CONCERNS -- "never a self-grade", and the interrupt-rerun gotcha.
This node ONLY scores; it NEVER changes a shot's `status`. The decision (retry /
human-review / pass) is the Continuity Gate's job (§5.10 control flow), which is
a SEPARATE downstream node. That split is not cosmetic: the Gate is the node
that calls LangGraph `interrupt()`, and on resume LangGraph re-executes that
whole node from the top. Keeping the expensive, non-deterministic Qwen-VL
scoring in THIS node means resuming a human decision never pointlessly re-fires
the vision model -- the drift scores are already committed to state by the time
the Gate runs.

FAILURE ISOLATION (conservative). One shot's Qwen-VL/ffmpeg failure must not
block the others (same posture as every node in this pipeline). On such a
failure we do NOT silently pass the shot Continuity couldn't actually check:
we write the WORST-CASE score (`_FAILED_DRIFT_SCORE = 1.0`, definitively over
any sane threshold) rather than a passing one, so the shot flows into the Gate's
retry/review path instead of sneaking through unverified. The `drift_scored`
event for that shot therefore carries `passed=False`.

FRAME EXTRACTION. We download the generated clip to a temp file (httpx, same
pattern as agents/_oss.py's `_download_to_temp`, which we reuse directly) and
pull ONE frame near the clip's midpoint via ffmpeg
(`ffmpeg -ss <duration/2> -i <clip> -frames:v 1 <out>.jpg`), cleaning up both
temp files afterward. The midpoint (not frame 0) is deliberate: a clip's opening
frame is often still settling from the reference still, so mid-clip is the more
honest test of whether the product held its identity through the motion.

`candidate_frame_uris` NOTE (deliberately simple, per the Phase 4 scope call).
This node does NOT separately persist the extracted still to OSS. The Continuity
Gate populates a review entry's `candidate_frame_uris` with the CLIP's own
`video_uri` (a reviewer can scrub it), which avoids adding an image-upload path
to agents/_oss.py (whose helper is video/mp4-shaped) for a still we only needed
transiently to score. Building the actual review UI is explicitly out of scope
here, so the simpler option is the right one -- see agents/continuity_gate.py.

INJECTABLE DEPENDENCIES (same `client=None` testability pattern as every other
agent here). `client` (an AsyncOpenAI-compatible Qwen-VL client) and
`extract_frame_fn` (the ffmpeg-boundary frame extractor) are both injectable, so
tests fake the vision call and the ffmpeg step without touching real DashScope
or ffmpeg -- matching how tests/_phase3_graph.py fakes Ken-Burns's render step.

FRAME-0(ISH) IDENTITY CHECK (v8 fix -- Meta Quest -> "phone on a stand"
wrong-object bug). This is a SECOND, INDEPENDENT check alongside the drift
score above, not a stricter threshold on the same [0,1] scale. Drift asks a
CONTINUOUS question ("how similar is this frame to the reference,
color/shape/style-wise"); identity asks a CATEGORICAL one ("is this even the
same physical object class at all"). A wrong-object generation can plausibly
score a misleadingly moderate drift (lighting/composition can still roughly
match), so a purely continuous check is not guaranteed to catch it -- hence a
dedicated categorical verdict, `DRIFT_THRESHOLD` never involved.

Deliberately NOT frame 0 -- i2v models keep frame 0 tightly conditioned on the
reference image (often near-identical), so an identity check AT t=0 can
trivially pass even when the clip drifts to the wrong object by t=1s. We check
an EARLY frame instead: `at_sec = max(0.4, 0.1 * duration_sec_used)`. This
reuses the frame-extraction boundary generalized below (`extract_frame`, of
which `extract_midpoint_frame` is now a thin wrapper) with a different seek
target, and a SEPARATE Qwen-VL call (`_call_qwen_vl_identity`) with its own
system prompt (`_IDENTITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) forcing feature-by-feature evidence
BEFORE a same_object verdict -- deliberate field ordering (mirrors this
module's BaseModel-validation posture below) that measurably reduces blind-
approval bias in multimodal judging.

Runs ALONGSIDE drift scoring in `score_continuity`, same scope restriction
(only un-scored `status == "passed"` shots -- see WHY SCORE ONLY "passed"
SHOTS / WHY SCORE ONLY UN-SCORED CLIPS above) and the SAME conservative
failure posture: an identity-check failure (bad JSON, API error, ffmpeg
failure) is recorded as the worst case, `same_object=False`, never silently
passed -- exactly mirroring `_FAILED_DRIFT_SCORE`'s posture for drift. Written
onto `generated_shots[shot_id]["identity_check"]`, ADDITIVE alongside
`drift_score` (graph/state.py v8), never replacing it. This node still only
SCORES -- `agents/continuity_gate.py` owns the routing decision on a hard
identity failure, exactly as it already owns the drift-retry/review decision.

    check is caught and isolated from the other (drift and identity are two
    independent checks against two independently-extracted frames -- one
    failing must not silently skip or corrupt the other). A failed drift check
    is recorded as the worst-case `_FAILED_DRIFT_SCORE`; a failed identity
    check is recorded as the worst-case `same_object=False` -- both mirror the
    same "never silently pass" posture (see module docstring). Does NOT change
    any shot's `status` -- that is the Continuity Gate's job.
