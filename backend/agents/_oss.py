"""
Shared OSS (Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service) upload helper.

INTENTIONALLY REUSABLE -- NOT KEN-BURNS-SPECIFIC. This lives in
`agents/_oss.py` (the same underscore-prefixed shared-helper convention as
`agents/_retry.py`), NOT buried as a private function inside
`ken_burns_fallback_node.py`, because the exact same capability -- "take a
locally-produced shot asset and persist it to the job's OSS namespace, then
hand back a signed URL other nodes/the dashboard can read" -- is needed by more
than one node. The Ken-Burns Fallback Node (§5.9) is the FIRST caller; a
second RR task ("upload generated shot assets to OSS", the real Video-Gen
persistence path per §5.8's "with the clip persisted to OSS", now built as
`persist_remote_video_to_oss` below) needs the identical operation. Building
it once here keeps the OSS key
convention (`jobs/{job_id}/shots/{shot_id}/...`) and the signed-URL lifetime in
a single source of truth instead of two hand-rolled copies that could drift.

FIRST REAL OSS IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS CODEBASE. `.env.example` already declares
`OSS_ENDPOINT` / `OSS_BUCKET` / `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`
(the four values `oss2.Auth`/`oss2.Bucket` need), and `oss2>=2.19.1` is already
a requirement, but nothing had actually called them yet -- this is that code.

INJECTABLE CLIENT (same `client=None` pattern every agent module in this
codebase uses for testability): pass a `bucket` object exposing
`put_object_from_file(key, local_path, headers=...)` and
`sign_url(method, key, expires, slash_safe=...)` to fake OSS entirely in tests
with no real credentials/network. The real `oss2.Bucket` is constructed from
the environment only when `bucket` is not supplied.

ADDITIVE (Phase 5, Voiceover + Caption Agent, agents/voiceover_caption_agent.py):
that node needs to persist two NEW asset kinds -- a synthesized VO audio track
and a caption-timing JSON file -- neither a "shot asset" (there is no shot_id;
VO is produced once per job, not once per shot). Rather than hand-rolling a
second put_object_from_file/sign_url pair (exactly the "two hand-rolled copies
that could drift" this module's own docstring above warns against), the
shared put+sign mechanics are factored into the private `_put_and_sign` helper
and reused by THREE thin wrappers: the pre-existing `upload_video_to_oss`
(refactored to call it, behavior unchanged -- see test_oss.py, unmodified and
still green) and the two new ones below. A parallel `oss_job_asset_key` sits
next to `oss_object_key` for these job-level (non-shot) assets --
`jobs/{job_id}/{filename}`, dropping the `shots/{shot_id}` segment that would
otherwise misname a job-wide asset as if it belonged to one shot.
