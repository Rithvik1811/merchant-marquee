Continuity Gate -- capped retry + autonomous auto-accept (Phase 4).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.10 (control flow / failure
handling).

AUTONOMY NOTE (current behavior). This pipeline is FULLY AUTONOMOUS: there is
no human-in-the-loop. The retry-exhausted branch below no longer calls
LangGraph's `interrupt()` -- it auto-accepts the best-available generated clip
instead. Ken-Burns static-image fallback is reserved for HARD failures (a
Video-Gen infra/API failure, or two consecutive hard-identity failures), NOT
for continuity-quality drift. The `interrupt()`/human-review machinery once
described here (and the `_apply_resolution` helper / `HumanReviewEntry` type,
kept below only for backward reference) is no longer wired into the node.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Turn the drift scores the Continuity Agent
(agents/continuity_agent.py) already wrote into DECISIONS. For every real
(`status == "passed"`) shot that carries a `drift_score`, this node applies
§5.10's three-way control flow:

  1. Drift within threshold (`drift_score <= DRIFT_THRESHOLD`)
     -> leave the shot exactly as-is (stays "passed"). It passes to Assembly.

  2. Drift over threshold AND `retry_count < MAX_AUTO_RETRIES`
     -> automatic re-generation. Set `status = "pending"` (the existing frozen
     value Video-Gen's filter treats as "(re-)generate this") and increment
     `retry_count` by 1. THIS NODE IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE PIPELINE THAT EVER
     INCREMENTS `retry_count` -- Video-Gen and Ken-Burns both explicitly never
     touch it (their own docstrings + a grep confirm this), reserving the whole
     retry budget for quality-driven drift retries per §5.8/§5.9.

  3. Drift over threshold AND retries exhausted (`retry_count >= MAX_AUTO_RETRIES`)
     -> AUTO-ACCEPT the best-available clip. Keep `status="passed"` and stamp the
     clip's generated_shots entry with `CONTINUITY_APPROVED_KEY` so a later loop
     pass (driven by a different shot) doesn't re-evaluate this still-over-
     threshold clip. No `interrupt()`, no human review, no Ken-Burns -- the shot
     flows straight to Assembly with the closest generation we could produce.

THE INTERRUPT RE-RUN CONTRACT (why the scoring is in the PREVIOUS node). On
resume, LangGraph re-executes this ENTIRE node from the top; each prior
`interrupt()` call returns its stored resume value instead of pausing again, and
the next un-resumed one pauses. This node is therefore written to be cheap and
deterministic to re-run: it does NO model calls and NO I/O before/around the
interrupts -- it only re-reads state (drift scores already committed by the
Continuity Agent) and re-derives the same decisions. Nothing this node returns
is committed until it finishes WITHOUT pausing, so `retry_count` increments,
status changes, and `human_review_queue` all commit atomically on the final
resumed pass -- never doubled in COMMITTED STATE by a pause. (Verified against
LangGraph 1.2.7's real pause/resume mechanics, including empirically: a
paused-then-resumed run leaves exactly one entry in `human_review_queue` per
reviewed shot, not two.)

KNOWN, VERIFIED LIMITATION -- the `interrupt_requested` EVENT (not state) fires
TWICE per reviewed shot across a pause+resume cycle. The event dispatch sits
BEFORE `interrupt()` (so a live watcher learns *why* the pause happened, not
just that it did) -- but per the re-run contract above, that same dispatch line
re-executes on resume too, before this call's cached value is returned. Verified
directly: two `astream_events` passes (initial pause, then resume) each yield one
`interrupt_requested` event for the same shot_id -- committed STATE stays correct
(one queue entry), only the live stream double-announces. This is a known class
of LangGraph gotcha (side effects before `interrupt()` are not exactly-once) with
no clean IN-NODE fix: there is no way to distinguish "pausing now" from "resuming
now" from inside this node without help from whatever actually drives the graph
(detecting a genuinely-new pause by diffing `graph.get_state(config)` between
calls, and synthesizing the live notification from THERE instead of from inside
the node). That's WS/dashboard-driving-layer work, explicitly out of this phase's
scope (see docs/BUILD_TASKS.md's Phase 4 deferred-follow-up note) -- flagged
here, not silently left for someone to rediscover the hard way, and locked in by
a test (`test_interrupt_requested_event_fires_twice_across_pause_resume_known_limitation`
in test_continuity_gate.py) so a future accidental "fix" that makes it stop
firing AT ALL (worse: no live notification at all) would be caught.

MULTI-SHOT REVIEW IN ONE BATCH. If several shots exhaust retries in the same
run, we call `interrupt()` once per shot, IN SHOT-LIST ORDER. LangGraph pauses
at the first, and a resumer supplies one resume value per pause
(`Command(resume=<resolution>)`), matched back to the interrupts in call order --
so resolutions route to the correct shot deterministically.

RESUME PAYLOAD SHAPE. The resume value is the human's choice, shaped to mirror
`HumanReviewEntry.resolution`'s frozen Literal so applying it is trivial:
`{"resolution": "approve" | "retry_with_edit" | "accept_fallback"}` (a bare
string is also accepted defensively). Applied by `_apply_resolution`:
  * "approve"         -> accept as generated despite the flag: `status` back to
                         "passed". The clip's drift_score STAYS over threshold
                         (it genuinely drifted; the human just accepted it), so
                         we ALSO stamp the clip's generated_shots entry with a
                         durable `continuity_approved` marker. Without it, a LATER
                         retry-loop pass driven by a DIFFERENT shot would re-read
                         this shot's still-over-threshold, retries-exhausted entry
                         and re-raise a human-review interrupt for an already-
                         approved shot (approval would not be durable across
                         passes). The Gate skips any entry carrying that marker.
  * "retry_with_edit" -> a human-authorized one-off retry. `status = "pending"`
                         so Video-Gen picks it up again. Deliberately NOT gated
                         by the `retry_count < MAX_AUTO_RETRIES` cap -- the cap
                         bounds UNSUPERVISED spend, not an informed human choice
                         (§5.10). We still increment `retry_count` for trace
                         visibility, but a value >= the cap does not block it.
  * "accept_fallback" -> `status = "fallback_requested"` -- the EXACT existing
                         Phase 3 hand-off contract, so the shot flows back through
                         the already-built ken_burns_fallback_node on the next
                         pass and gets a working Ken-Burns clip for free (no new
                         fallback logic here).
  * anything else     -> logged; the shot is left in "review" (still visibly
                         needs handling, never silently passed).

WHY THIS NODE OWNS NO THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN. `DRIFT_THRESHOLD` is imported from
agents/continuity_agent.py (the scorer defines the scale). MAX_AUTO_RETRIES is
the local, env-overridable cap (§5.10's "retry_count < 2"), same
flag-don't-hardcode-forever pattern as budget_gate.py's DEFAULT_JOB_BUDGET_CAP.

HARD IDENTITY FAILURE (v8 fix -- Meta Quest -> "phone on a stand" wrong-object
bug). `agents/continuity_agent.py` now writes a SECOND, independent verdict
onto a scored clip's entry: `identity_check.same_object` (a categorical "is
this even the same physical object class" check on an early frame, NOT a
stricter threshold on `drift_score`'s continuous scale -- see that module's
own docstring). `same_object == false` -- regardless of `confidence`, per the
identity prompt's own "do not give the benefit of the doubt" instruction -- is
treated as a HARD failure, routed by a SEPARATE, ADDITIVE decision layered
BEFORE the existing drift-threshold branch below:
  * Every hard identity failure for a shot -> automatic retry (`status="pending"`,
    `retry_count` incremented, NOT counted against `MAX_AUTO_RETRIES`). The streak
    counter (`IDENTITY_HARD_FAIL_STREAK_KEY`) is still incremented on every failure
    for observability, but there is NO Ken-Burns routing path for identity failures
    -- we keep re-sampling regardless of streak length. Budget overrun is preferred
    over falling back to a static Ken-Burns clip.
  * A CONSECUTIVE-failure streak is tracked via `IDENTITY_HARD_FAIL_STREAK_KEY`,
    an extra, undeclared key written directly onto the Shot dict (not a C1
    schema field -- `graph.shot_schema.validate_shot_list`'s `extra="forbid"`
    Pydantic gate only ever runs ONCE, in `agents/shot_list_agent.py`'s own
    assembly step, before a shot ever reaches this node; every downstream
    node's `{**shot, ...}` spread already preserves arbitrary extra keys
    unvalidated, exactly the same "costs nothing" posture video_gen_node.py's
    "KNOWN DEPARTURES" #3 already established for GeneratedShot's
    resolution_used/duration_sec_used/budget_clamped). It resets to 0 the
    moment a pass's identity check comes back `same_object=true` again, so a
    much LATER, unrelated hard failure is never mistaken for a second
    consecutive one.
  * A shot that never hard-fails identity (the overwhelming common case: no
    `identity_check` on the entry, or `same_object=true`) falls straight
    through to the existing drift-threshold branch below, completely
    untouched by any of this -- this is why every pre-existing drift/retry/
    interrupt test in this suite needed zero changes for this fix.

THE RETRY CYCLE (wired in graph/build.py). After this node,
`route_after_continuity_gate` sends the run back to `video_gen` iff any shot
still needs a pass -- "pending" (an auto-retry or a human retry_with_edit) OR
"fallback_requested" (a human accept_fallback, which must reach Ken-Burns) --
else to END. That closes the loop `video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback ->
continuity_agent -> continuity_gate -> (loop | END)`, which is exactly why Phase 4
wires the graph here rather than leaving this standalone: a retry loop is a
graph-topology feature that cannot be meaningfully exercised outside the compiled
graph. See `route_after_continuity_gate` for why fallback_requested must loop.
