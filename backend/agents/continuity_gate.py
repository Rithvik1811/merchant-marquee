Continuity Gate -- capped retry + human-in-the-loop (Phase 4).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.10 (control flow / failure
handling) and §2.4's C4 (human-review) contract.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Turn the drift scores the Continuity Agent
(agents/continuity_agent.py) already wrote into DECISIONS. For every real
(`status == "passed"`) shot that carries a `drift_score`, this node applies
§5.10's three-way control flow:

  1. Drift within threshold (`drift_score <= DRIFT_THRESHOLD`)
     -> leave the shot exactly as-is (stays "passed"). It passes to Assembly.

  2. Drift over threshold AND `retry_count < MAX_AUTO_RETRIES`
     -> automatic re-generation. Set `status = "pending"` (the existing frozen
     value Video-Gen's filter treats as "(re-)generate this") and increment
     `retry_count` by 1. THIS NODE IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE PIPELINE THAT EVER
     INCREMENTS `retry_count` -- Video-Gen and Ken-Burns both explicitly never
     touch it (their own docstrings + a grep confirm this), reserving the whole
     retry budget for quality-driven drift retries per §5.8/§5.9.

  3. Drift over threshold AND retries exhausted (`retry_count >= MAX_AUTO_RETRIES`)
     -> a genuine LangGraph `interrupt()` (NOT a dead-end flag). We append a
     HumanReviewEntry to `state["human_review_queue"]`, emit an
     `interrupt_requested` C2 event, then call `interrupt(review_entry)`. The
     graph checkpoints and pauses; the flagged shot surfaces to whoever is
     watching the run. When the human resumes with a resolution, the graph
     resumes FROM THE CHECKPOINT (this node re-runs -- see the rerun note below)
     and we apply their choice.

THE INTERRUPT RE-RUN CONTRACT (why the scoring is in the PREVIOUS node). On
resume, LangGraph re-executes this ENTIRE node from the top; each prior
`interrupt()` call returns its stored resume value instead of pausing again, and
the next un-resumed one pauses. This node is therefore written to be cheap and
deterministic to re-run: it does NO model calls and NO I/O before/around the
interrupts -- it only re-reads state (drift scores already committed by the
Continuity Agent) and re-derives the same decisions. Nothing this node returns
is committed until it finishes WITHOUT pausing, so `retry_count` increments,
status changes, and `human_review_queue` all commit atomically on the final
resumed pass -- never doubled in COMMITTED STATE by a pause. (Verified against
LangGraph 1.2.7's real pause/resume mechanics, including empirically: a
paused-then-resumed run leaves exactly one entry in `human_review_queue` per
reviewed shot, not two.)

KNOWN, VERIFIED LIMITATION -- the `interrupt_requested` EVENT (not state) fires
TWICE per reviewed shot across a pause+resume cycle. The event dispatch sits
BEFORE `interrupt()` (so a live watcher learns *why* the pause happened, not
just that it did) -- but per the re-run contract above, that same dispatch line
re-executes on resume too, before this call's cached value is returned. Verified
directly: two `astream_events` passes (initial pause, then resume) each yield one
`interrupt_requested` event for the same shot_id -- committed STATE stays correct
(one queue entry), only the live stream double-announces. This is a known class
of LangGraph gotcha (side effects before `interrupt()` are not exactly-once) with
no clean IN-NODE fix: there is no way to distinguish "pausing now" from "resuming
now" from inside this node without help from whatever actually drives the graph
(detecting a genuinely-new pause by diffing `graph.get_state(config)` between
calls, and synthesizing the live notification from THERE instead of from inside
the node). That's WS/dashboard-driving-layer work, explicitly out of this phase's
scope (see docs/BUILD_TASKS.md's Phase 4 deferred-follow-up note) -- flagged
here, not silently left for someone to rediscover the hard way, and locked in by
a test (`test_interrupt_requested_event_fires_twice_across_pause_resume_known_limitation`
in test_continuity_gate.py) so a future accidental "fix" that makes it stop
firing AT ALL (worse: no live notification at all) would be caught.

MULTI-SHOT REVIEW IN ONE BATCH. If several shots exhaust retries in the same
run, we call `interrupt()` once per shot, IN SHOT-LIST ORDER. LangGraph pauses
at the first, and a resumer supplies one resume value per pause
(`Command(resume=<resolution>)`), matched back to the interrupts in call order --
so resolutions route to the correct shot deterministically.

RESUME PAYLOAD SHAPE. The resume value is the human's choice, shaped to mirror
`HumanReviewEntry.resolution`'s frozen Literal so applying it is trivial:
`{"resolution": "approve" | "retry_with_edit" | "accept_fallback"}` (a bare
string is also accepted defensively). Applied by `_apply_resolution`:
  * "approve"         -> accept as generated despite the flag: `status` back to
                         "passed". The clip's drift_score STAYS over threshold
                         (it genuinely drifted; the human just accepted it), so
                         we ALSO stamp the clip's generated_shots entry with a
                         durable `continuity_approved` marker. Without it, a LATER
                         retry-loop pass driven by a DIFFERENT shot would re-read
                         this shot's still-over-threshold, retries-exhausted entry
                         and re-raise a human-review interrupt for an already-
                         approved shot (approval would not be durable across
                         passes). The Gate skips any entry carrying that marker.
  * "retry_with_edit" -> a human-authorized one-off retry. `status = "pending"`
                         so Video-Gen picks it up again. Deliberately NOT gated
                         by the `retry_count < MAX_AUTO_RETRIES` cap -- the cap
                         bounds UNSUPERVISED spend, not an informed human choice
                         (§5.10). We still increment `retry_count` for trace
                         visibility, but a value >= the cap does not block it.
  * "accept_fallback" -> `status = "fallback_requested"` -- the EXACT existing
                         Phase 3 hand-off contract, so the shot flows back through
                         the already-built ken_burns_fallback_node on the next
                         pass and gets a working Ken-Burns clip for free (no new
                         fallback logic here).
  * anything else     -> logged; the shot is left in "review" (still visibly
                         needs handling, never silently passed).

WHY THIS NODE OWNS NO THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN. `DRIFT_THRESHOLD` is imported from
agents/continuity_agent.py (the scorer defines the scale). MAX_AUTO_RETRIES is
the local, env-overridable cap (§5.10's "retry_count < 2"), same
flag-don't-hardcode-forever pattern as budget_gate.py's DEFAULT_JOB_BUDGET_CAP.

THE RETRY CYCLE (wired in graph/build.py). After this node,
`route_after_continuity_gate` sends the run back to `video_gen` iff any shot
still needs a pass -- "pending" (an auto-retry or a human retry_with_edit) OR
"fallback_requested" (a human accept_fallback, which must reach Ken-Burns) --
else to END. That closes the loop `video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback ->
continuity_agent -> continuity_gate -> (loop | END)`, which is exactly why Phase 4
wires the graph here rather than leaving this standalone: a retry loop is a
graph-topology feature that cannot be meaningfully exercised outside the compiled
graph. See `route_after_continuity_gate` for why fallback_requested must loop.

    DELIBERATE SUPERSET of the §5.10 routing snippet (which names only "pending").
    The `accept_fallback` resolution sets a shot to `"fallback_requested"`, and the
    only node that turns that into a real `"fallback"` clip is
    ken_burns_fallback_node -- which sits UPSTREAM of Continuity on the loop
    (`video_gen -> ken_burns_fallback -> continuity_agent -> continuity_gate`). So
    a `fallback_requested` shot can ONLY reach Ken-Burns by looping back to
    `video_gen` (which passes it straight through its "pending"-only fan-out
    filter, untouched) and on to Ken-Burns. Routing only on "pending" would send an
    `accept_fallback` shot to END with no clip -- breaking the very contract that
    resolution promises ("flows back through ken_burns_fallback_node"). Including
    `fallback_requested` here is what makes `accept_fallback` actually work, and it
