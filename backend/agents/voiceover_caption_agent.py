"""
Voiceover + Caption Agent -- CosyVoice v3-flash (cosyvoice-v3-flash, DashScope
Singapore/intl) with per-beat pacing control (Phase 5).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.11.

TTS ENGINE: CosyVoice v3-flash (DashScope native), confirmed available on the
Singapore/intl region (wss://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api-ws/v1/inference).
Uses DASHSCOPE_TTS_API_KEY (the WebSocket JWT token) — NOT the standard
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY (REST key). SpeechSynthesizer speaks WebSocket; the WS URL
and key are separate from the REST API path used by text/vision agents.

NOTE on instruction/emotion: cosyvoice-v3 supports emotion control via the
`instruction` constructor parameter, but the instruction capability returned
error 428 (not included in this account's subscription tier). Emotion from the
Voice Direction Agent therefore shapes delivery only through the spoken_text
rewrite (contractions, phrasing, natural flow), not TTS-level instruction.
Pacing maps to speech_rate (0.85/1.0/1.10). Emotion is preserved in state for
forward-compatibility if instruction access is unlocked later.

When no directed beats are present, falls back to the raw beat lines at
normal speech_rate.

Confirmed against the ACTUAL merged code:
  * `graph.state.WinningScript` (C1, frozen): {text, beats: list[ScriptBeat],
    source_variant_ids}. `ScriptBeat` = {t_start, t_end, line}. There is no
    `beat_function` on a ScriptBeat; beat segmentation here is keyed on beat
    INDEX only.
  * `graph.state.DirectedBeat` (C1 v12): {beat_index, spoken_text, emotion,
    pacing}. `spoken_text` is the natural spoken rewrite fed to CosyVoice;
    `emotion` selects the Chinese instruct_text; `pacing` sets speech_rate.
  * `graph.state.Voiceover` (C1, frozen): `{audio_uri, caption_track_uri}` --
    both plain strings (OSS refs). The `{text, start_ts, end_ts}` caption array
    is serialized to a file, uploaded to OSS, and only the resulting signed URL
    lands in state, as `caption_track_uri`.

PARALLEL BRANCH, NOT A DOWNSTREAM STEP OF VIDEO-GEN. This module's entry point,
`voiceover_caption_agent_node`, reads ONLY `state["winning_script"]`,
`state["directed_script_beats"]`, and `state["job_id"]` -- never `treatment`,
`shot_list`, `budget_ledger`, or `generated_shots` -- and writes only
`state["voiceover"]` + `voiceover_reasoning_trace` (its OWN dedicated trace key,
not the shared `reasoning_trace`; see graph/state.py's v7 changelog).

WIRING (graph/build.py): meta_critic fans out to BOTH visual_direction_agent AND
voice_direction_agent in parallel after picking the winning script.
voice_direction_agent -> voiceover_caption_agent -> assembly_agent (defer=True).

REQUIREMENT 1 -- PER-BEAT vs. WHOLE-SCRIPT TTS. Chosen: PER-BEAT (one
CosyVoice call per beat). Why: docs §5.11's failure-handling sentence ("If
synthesis fails for a line, the node retries that line") only makes sense at
per-line granularity; per-beat also gives natural pause control at beat
boundaries, per-beat emotion/pacing tuning, and an exact (ffprobe-measured)
duration per beat before concatenating.

REQUIREMENT 2 -- CAPTION GRANULARITY AND TIMING. One caption entry per beat.
For a beat whose synthesis SUCCEEDED, start_ts/end_ts come from that beat's REAL
measured clip duration (ffmpeg.probe, cumulative from 0). For a beat whose
synthesis PERMANENTLY failed, the span is ESTIMATED: len(text.split()) /
WORDS_PER_SECOND (reusing agents.pacing_checker.WORDS_PER_SECOND), floored at
MIN_ESTIMATED_BEAT_SEC.

REQUIREMENT 3 -- OSS PERSISTENCE. Reuses agents/_oss.py (upload_audio_to_oss /
upload_json_to_oss) exclusively.

REQUIREMENT 4 -- EVENT. Emits the proposed C2 `vo_ready` event
({voiceover, caption_count, degraded}) via adispatch_custom_event.

REQUIREMENT 5 -- FAILURE HANDLING / DEGRADE PATH. Per-beat retry once, then
degrade that single beat to a silent gap + estimated-timing caption, NEVER halt
the whole node/job over one bad line (docs §5.11). Each beat gets at most 2
attempts (1 initial + 1 retry) via `_synthesize_beat`; a beat that fails both
contributes a silent gap (ffmpeg anullsrc) of its estimated duration. The
returned `voiceover` dict always has audio_uri + caption_track_uri; when >=1
beat degraded it additionally carries `failure_reason` ({type, detail}, reusing
graph.state.FailureReason's frozen "timeout"/"api_error" vocabulary) and
`silent_beat_indices: list[int]`.

OUTPUT AUDIO FORMAT -- MP3 (libmp3lame); ffmpeg re-encodes every per-beat clip
through `aformat` before concatenation, so the output format is fixed
regardless of the per-beat source format.

CREDENTIALS: DASHSCOPE_TTS_API_KEY (WebSocket JWT token, different from the
REST DASHSCOPE_API_KEY). SpeechSynthesizer uses WebSocket, not HTTP REST.
Voice, model, and WS URL are env-overridable. See .env.example.
