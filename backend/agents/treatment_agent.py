"""
Treatment Agent — Qwen-Plus via DashScope (Phase 2).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.5.

Output shape is constrained to the frozen C1 contract (`graph.state.Treatment`
/ `BeatTreatment`): {director_persona, color_story, pacing_philosophy,
beat_treatments: [{beat_index, beat_function, script_quote, truth_fact_id,
visual_approach, why_not_generic}], character_anchor (v10, NotRequired)}.
`beat_function` is C1's 5-value enum (hook/problem/demo/proof/cta, shared with
`Shot.beat_role`) -- if that enum ever needs a new value, that's a C1 change
requiring a KR/RR sync and a version bump in graph/state.py, not a unilateral
addition here.

CHARACTER ANCHOR (v10, video-gen-fidelity story-arc fix, graph/state.py
Treatment v10). Text-only i2v prompting cannot lock FACIAL identity across
independent Wan generations (no video-to-video chaining, no seed guarantee --
confirmed against Alibaba's own docs), but it CAN reliably hold wardrobe
color/hair/setting across independent calls when those are pinned once and
reused verbatim. `character_anchor` is that pin: ONE sentence, produced HERE
(not by Concept Agent -- Concept Agent still produces 4 competing variants
before a winner exists, so synthesizing a character per variant would be
wasted work; this module already runs once on the winning script and already
owns other whole-ad global fields of identical shape: director_persona,
color_story, pacing_philosophy), and ONLY when the winning script actually
implies a person (`_script_implies_person` below, a deterministic pronoun/
generic-person-word scan mirroring Concept Agent's own PRONOUN THREAD check)
-- never forced onto a product-only script. Consumed verbatim by
agents/video_gen_node.py's new `Cast:` prompt section on every human-
interaction shot.

One beat_treatments[] entry per winning_script.beats[] entry, same index and
order -- beat_index is that list position, not an independent numbering.

Per-beat grounding checks (verbatim quote, real truth_fact_id, valid
beat_function, banned-word/stoplist) are delegated to
agents.justification_validator.validate_justifications -- the same function
Shot-List Agent's per-shot ShotJustification validation uses (Phase 2
interface handoff, docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.6). This module owns
only what's specific to Treatment Agent: prompting, matching returned entries
back to expected beat slots, the missing-entry-entirely case (the shared
validator only judges justifications that exist), the re-prompt/fallback
control flow, and the top-level (non-per-beat) director_persona/color_story/
pacing_philosophy banned-word check.

Failure handling deviates slightly from the doc's literal "re-prompts once
for that beat specifically" framing: this reuses the same whole-response,
name-the-violation retry shape as every other agent in this codebase
(Concept Agent, Product Truth Extractor, Hook-Checker) -- one bounded
re-prompt naming exactly which beat_index failed and why, not a separate
isolated API call per beat. Cheaper, and still surgical (violations are
named per beat, only the bad beats are called out), just not literally one
call per beat. A beat still failing after that retry falls back
deterministically to the doc's literal lowest-risk treatment (static
framing, shared lighting only) rather than blocking the job.

WIRED into graph/build.py: `treatment_agent -> shot_list_agent -> budget_gate
-> video_gen`, downstream of `winning_script` (set by merge_validator_node).
Was standalone and tested before that, same posture hook_checker.py was in
before its siblings existed; that follow-up wiring has since landed.

You will receive:
- The winning script's full text and its beats as a numbered list (numbered
  0 to {last}, in order)
- product_truths: a list of {{truth_id, category, fact}}

Produce a director's treatment with:
1. director_persona: a short description of the visual/directorial voice for
   this specific ad (e.g. "intimate, handheld warmth" vs "crisp, editorial
   precision") -- must be justified by something in the script's tone, not a
   generic "modern and clean" default.
2. color_story: the intended color palette/mood, grounded in the product's
   actual visible colors/materials from product_truths.
3. pacing_philosophy: how the ad should feel to move through (e.g. "slow
   build then a quick punch on the CTA") tied to the script's beat structure.
4. beat_treatments: EXACTLY {beat_count} entries, one per script beat listed
   above, in the same order (beat_index 0 through {last}). For each:
   - beat_index: the beat's position in the numbered list above (integer)
   - beat_function: this beat's narrative role -- one of exactly:
     {", ".join(BEAT_FUNCTIONS)}. Reason from what the beat is DOING
     narratively -- for "hook", match whatever the script's own opening beat
     is actually doing: a human moment (intimacy/recognition), a curiosity
     gap (an unresolved question), or a claim (shock/tension) -- never assume
     shock/tension by default. problem = discomfort, demo/proof =
     trust/clarity, cta = urgency/clarity. Never reason from the product's category.
   - script_quote: a VERBATIM quote from that beat's own line (must match
     exactly, word for word -- this will be validated)
   - truth_fact_id: the specific product_truths[] truth_id this beat's
     visual choice is grounded in
   - visual_approach: {visual_approach_desc}
   - why_not_generic: 1-2 sentences explaining why this visual choice is
     specific to THIS product, not a generic stock-footage choice any
     similar product could use
{character_anchor_field}

REAL-WORLD USE NUDGE (secondary, for demo/proof beats only): when a beat's
beat_function is "demo" or "proof" and the script beat and cited truths
support it, prefer a visual_approach describing a real daily-life moment or
use-state of the product (someone using/wearing/carrying it) over another
static material/construction observation -- a demo/proof beat exists to show
the product EARNING its claim in the real world, not just to re-describe its
surface again. This is a preference, not a hard rule; the Shot-List Agent
downstream is where this actually gets enforced.
{hook_human_moment_rule}

HARD RULES:
- Never use the word "{BANNED_WORD}" anywhere in your output, especially not
  in why_not_generic or visual_approach.
- Every beat_treatment must cite a real truth_id that exists in the provided
  product_truths list -- never invent or hallucinate a fact.
- script_quote must be an exact, verbatim substring of that beat's own line --
  no paraphrasing, no partial-match approximations.
- Every visual_approach/why_not_generic must reason from the beat's
  narrative function and the cited fact, not from what kind of product this is.
