"""
Treatment Agent — Qwen-Plus via DashScope (Phase 2).
Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.5.

Output shape is constrained to the frozen C1 contract (`graph.state.Treatment`
/ `BeatTreatment`): {director_persona, color_story, pacing_philosophy,
beat_treatments: [{beat_index, beat_function, script_quote, truth_fact_id,
visual_approach, why_not_generic}]}. `beat_function` is C1's 5-value enum
(hook/problem/demo/proof/cta, shared with `Shot.beat_role`) -- if that enum
ever needs a new value, that's a C1 change requiring a KR/RR sync and a
version bump in graph/state.py, not a unilateral addition here.

One beat_treatments[] entry per winning_script.beats[] entry, same index and
order -- beat_index is that list position, not an independent numbering.

Per-beat grounding checks (verbatim quote, real truth_fact_id, valid
beat_function, banned-word/stoplist) are delegated to
agents.justification_validator.validate_justifications -- the same function
Shot-List Agent's per-shot ShotJustification validation uses (Phase 2
interface handoff, docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.6). This module owns
only what's specific to Treatment Agent: prompting, matching returned entries
back to expected beat slots, the missing-entry-entirely case (the shared
validator only judges justifications that exist), the re-prompt/fallback
control flow, and the top-level (non-per-beat) director_persona/color_story/
pacing_philosophy banned-word check.

Failure handling deviates slightly from the doc's literal "re-prompts once
for that beat specifically" framing: this reuses the same whole-response,
name-the-violation retry shape as every other agent in this codebase
(Concept Agent, Product Truth Extractor, Hook-Checker) -- one bounded
re-prompt naming exactly which beat_index failed and why, not a separate
isolated API call per beat. Cheaper, and still surgical (violations are
named per beat, only the bad beats are called out), just not literally one
call per beat. A beat still failing after that retry falls back
deterministically to the doc's literal lowest-risk treatment (static
framing, shared lighting only) rather than blocking the job.

NOT wired into graph/build.py yet: winning_script is the last thing that
graph sets (via merge_validator_node), and nothing downstream of it is wired
in (see graph/build.py's own module docstring). Standalone and tested, same
as hook_checker.py was before its siblings existed, so whoever wires the
Shot-List Agent in can also wire this in immediately before it.

product ad (15-30s), grounded in the winning script and specific product
facts -- never in generic category knowledge.

You will receive:
- The winning script's full text and its beats as a numbered list (numbered
  0 to {last}, in order)
- product_truths: a list of {{truth_id, category, fact}}

Produce a director's treatment with:
1. director_persona: a short description of the visual/directorial voice for
   this specific ad (e.g. "intimate, handheld warmth" vs "crisp, editorial
   precision") -- must be justified by something in the script's tone, not a
   generic "modern and clean" default.
2. color_story: the intended color palette/mood, grounded in the product's
   actual visible colors/materials from product_truths.
3. pacing_philosophy: how the ad should feel to move through (e.g. "slow
   build then a quick punch on the CTA") tied to the script's beat structure.
4. beat_treatments: EXACTLY {beat_count} entries, one per script beat listed
   above, in the same order (beat_index 0 through {last}). For each:
   - beat_index: the beat's position in the numbered list above (integer)
   - beat_function: this beat's narrative role -- one of exactly:
     {", ".join(BEAT_FUNCTIONS)}. Reason from what the beat is DOING
     narratively (hook = shock/tension, problem = discomfort, demo/proof =
     trust/clarity, cta = urgency/clarity), never from the product's category.
   - script_quote: a VERBATIM quote from that beat's own line (must match
     exactly, word for word -- this will be validated)
   - truth_fact_id: the specific product_truths[] truth_id this beat's
     visual choice is grounded in
   - visual_approach: the specific camera/framing/lighting approach for this
     beat (e.g. "static macro push on the seam, no camera movement")
   - why_not_generic: 1-2 sentences explaining why this visual choice is
     specific to THIS product, not a generic stock-footage choice any
     similar product could use

HARD RULES:
- Never use the word "{BANNED_WORD}" anywhere in your output, especially not
  in why_not_generic or visual_approach.
- Every beat_treatment must cite a real truth_id that exists in the provided
  product_truths list -- never invent or hallucinate a fact.
- script_quote must be an exact, verbatim substring of that beat's own line --
  no paraphrasing, no partial-match approximations.
- Every visual_approach/why_not_generic must reason from the beat's
  narrative function and the cited fact, not from what kind of product this is.
