"""
Copy Editor ("CE", §5.4.8) of the Critic Chain's merge-repair path.

Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.4.8 (this node), §5.4.7 (the
Merge Coherence Validator, "CV" -- this node's only caller), §4 (architecture
diagram: `CV -->|voice/register fail, attempts<1| CE`, `CE --> CV`), §6
(`merge_attempts[].copy_edit` shape).

Scope. A cross-pollinated merge (agents.meta_critic's `MergeCandidate`) stitches
a hook, body, and CTA that were each written for a *different* script. When the
independent Merge Coherence Validator's blind cold read flags a voice/register
clash at one of the two stitch points (hook->body or body->CTA), the honest
repair is a professional copy editor's constrained polish of that single seam
line -- not a rewrite, not a swap to a different pre-written piece (that piece
also wasn't written for this hook), and never a self-grade (the patched
candidate always goes back through the same CV for a full re-check; this node
never marks its own work sufficient).

This module is deliberately NOT the Merge Coherence Validator: it depends on
exactly one thing from `agents.merge_validator` -- the locked `SeamFlag` model,
which names WHICH beat is editable (always the adjacent BODY beat; the CV has
already ruled out the hook beat and the CTA beat as edit targets before this
node ever sees a `SeamFlag`). It does not import, call, or duplicate any of
that module's actual validation logic.

Scope note -- what this is NOT:
  * NOT wired into `backend/graph/build.py` (that graph-wiring integration is
    the orchestrating session's job once both this file and merge_validator.py
    are complete, to avoid two agents colliding on the same shared file).
  * NOT an editor of `backend/graph/state.py` -- the CV agent owns the
    additive state-schema changes (`merge_attempts`, `pending_merge_candidate`,
    `winning_script` finalization). This node's `copy_editor_node` wrapper
    documents, in its own docstring, exactly which state keys it *assumes* for
    reading/writing, so the orchestrating session can reconcile them against
    whatever `merge_validator_node` actually lands on.
  * NOT the Meta-Critic (§5.4.6) or the Concept Agent (§5.3) -- this node never
    generates new copy or selects among pre-written pieces; it only polishes
    the literal text already sitting at one or two named beat indices.

The deterministic / LLM split (same "mechanical where mechanical is possible"
posture as the Pacing-Checker and Body-Checker):
  * The ONE LLM call (Qwen-Plus via the shared `critic_llm.call_qwen_json`)
    proposes a revised line for each flagged seam, grounded in the CV's own
    cold-read justification and the seam's neighboring line.
  * `_check_constraints` is pure code, no LLM: it deterministically verifies
    the model actually stayed inside its license (no beat outside the named
    indices changed, no timestamp anywhere moved, the hook/CTA beats were
    never touched, word count stayed within ~10%, and no numeric token present
    in the original line silently vanished). A prompt alone is necessary but
    not sufficient to guarantee this -- exactly the reasoning behind
    Body-Checker's deterministic hard-cap and the Meta-Critic's deterministic
    re-timing step.
  * On a constraint-check failure, `copy_edit_seams` re-prompts ONCE, naming
    the specific violation(s) (the same "re-prompt once, then fall back"
    convention as the Concept Agent / other checkers). A second failure ships
    the ORIGINAL, unmodified candidate with `constraint_check.passed=False` --
    a failed `ConstraintCheck` IS the signal to the caller (CV), not an
    exception; CE never partially or silently ships a bad edit.

_COPY_EDITOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a COPY EDITOR performing a constrained seam repair on an ad script stitched \
from pieces by different writers (a cross-pollinated merge). A validator has \
independently cold-read the stitched script and flagged a voice/register clash at one \
or more specific seams. Your license is a copy editor's, not a writer's: you smooth HOW \
it is said at the flagged transition; you never change WHAT is said, anywhere.

YOU MAY rewrite ONLY the line(s) at the beat index(es) given to you below. Return a \
revision for EACH of those indices and nothing else -- do not return any other beat's \
line, edited or not.

YOU MAY NOT, under any circumstance:
- introduce any new claim, number, benefit, or product detail not already in the \
original line;
- drop any claim, number, or detail the original line already carried;
- touch the hook line or the CTA line, even if you think they would read better;
- move content from one line to another;
- change a line's length by more than roughly 10% of its original word count.

If a seam cannot be smoothed inside these rules, return the ORIGINAL line UNCHANGED for \
that beat index and say so plainly in your justification -- exceeding your license is a \
worse failure than an unfixed seam.

Ground yourself in the validator's own justification for WHY the seam clashes (given \
below as `coherence_justification`) and the seam's neighboring line (the hook line for \
a hook_body seam, the CTA line for a body_cta seam) -- match register, energy, and \
address to that neighbor, and nothing more.

CALIBRATION:
- STRONG repair: body opener "Many people find their drinks losing warmth too quickly" \
sitting after the hook "Your coffee is cold in 12 minutes. Mine isn't." becomes "Yours \
does too -- here's why mine doesn't:". This picks up the hook's direct address and \
energy, and every downstream claim in the body is left completely untouched.
- WEAK (out of scope, do NOT do this): rewriting the whole body paragraph in the hook's \
voice, adding a new stat to make the transition punchier, or cutting a sentence for \
pace. Any of these is a rewrite, not a copy-edit, and it destroys the guarantees \
(grounding, non-redundancy, pacing) that got this piece chosen by the checkers in the \
first place.

Return ONLY a JSON object of exactly this shape (no prose outside it):
{"revised_lines": {"<beat_index>": "<revised line>", ...}, \
"justification": "<1-2 sentences: what register clash you smoothed, at which beat(s), \
and how -- or why you left a line unchanged>"}
Keys of "revised_lines" MUST be exactly the beat index(es) given to you, as strings. Do \
not add, omit, or renumber keys. No prose outside the JSON.\

async def copy_editor_node(state: ProductCutState, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:  # noqa: ARG001
    """LangGraph node wrapper for the Copy Editor (§5.4.8), following
    meta_critic_node's / body_checker_node's style (asyncio.to_thread around
    the sync/blocking `copy_edit_seams` call).

    STATE-KEY ASSUMPTIONS -- merge_validator_node was not finished (only the
    four locked Pydantic models existed) when this file was written, so the
    exact keys `merge_validator.py` reads/writes are unconfirmed. This node
    assumes:

      READS:
        - state["pending_merge_candidate"]: dict shape of a `MergeCandidate` --
          the merge candidate CV just evaluated and flagged voice/register on.
        - state["coherence_validation_result"]: dict shape of a
          `CoherenceValidationResult` -- specifically its `seam_flags` and
          `justification` fields.
        - state["script_variants"]: to recover `grounding_truth_ids` for the
          three source variants (hook/body/cta) referenced by the candidate.

      WRITES:
        - state["pending_merge_candidate"]: REPLACED with the patched candidate
          (`result.patched_candidate.model_dump()`) so CV's next call
          re-validates the repair, per the `CE --> CV` edge in §4.
        - state["last_copy_edit"]: the full `CopyEditResult.model_dump()`. This
          is a dedicated, clearly-documented key rather than a guessed append
          into `merge_attempts[...].copy_edit` (§6) -- the orchestrating
          session should fold this into the right `merge_attempts` entry
          during final graph wiring, once merge_validator.py's actual list-
          append mechanics are known, rather than risk silently corrupting a
          list another node also appends to.

    If `merge_validator_node`'s real key names differ, only the state.get(...)
    calls below and the two dict keys in the return value need reconciling --
    `copy_edit_seams` itself has no state coupling at all.
