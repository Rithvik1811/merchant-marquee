CTA-Checker (§5.4.4) and Tone-Checker (§5.4.5) of the Critic Chain.

Spec of record: docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md §5.4.4 / §5.4.5. These are two of
the five parallel specialist checkers that score the Concept Agent's four
structurally-distinct `ScriptVariant`s (§5.3) along orthogonal axes, before the
Meta-Critic (§5.4.6) reconciles them into a cross-pollinated merge candidate.

Both checkers live in one module because they share *all* of their calling and
validation infrastructure (see `critic_llm.call_qwen_json`) and differ only in
rubric and output shape — but they remain two independent public functions
(`check_cta`, `check_tone`) because they are conceptually distinct scoring axes
that the Meta-Critic weights separately (CTA 20%, Tone 15%) and that run in
parallel, not in sequence.

Scope note — what these are NOT:
  * WIRED into the live LangGraph graph (backend/graph/build.py): fan out from
    concept_agent in parallel with Hook-/Pacing-/Body-Checker, fanning back in
    to meta_critic. Were standalone, independently-callable functions before
    the Concept Agent existed; that follow-up wiring has since landed.
  * NOT the other checkers. Hook (§5.4.1), Pacing (§5.4.2), Body (§5.4.3),
    Meta-Critic (§5.4.6), Merge Coherence Validator (§5.4.7) and Copy Editor
    (§5.4.8) are separate tasks and are deliberately out of scope here.
  * They do NOT populate `graph.state.CriticScore` directly. Each checker returns
    only its own axis (cta / tone + never_do_violation); the Meta-Critic is what
    assembles the full CriticScore composite. We import the C1 `ScriptVariant` /
    `SellerDirection` types (never redefine them) for input typing only.

Design of the output validation: following the precedent set by
`graph.shot_schema` (a `TypedDict` is a shape hint with *no* runtime checking, so
raw LLM JSON gets a real Pydantic model gate before it is trusted), each checker's
per-variant result is validated by a small Pydantic model here — score in the 1-5
range, justification non-empty, and (critically for Tone) `never_do_violation` an
actual `bool`, not a truthy string the LLM happened to emit. The hard `never_do`
gate that the Meta-Critic relies on (§5.4.6: "Any variant with never_do_violation
= true is excluded ... regardless of composite score") is only as trustworthy as
this bool being a real bool, which is exactly why it is validated rather than
passed through raw.

_CTA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a direct-response advertising critic. Score the call-to-action (CTA) \
of each short-form video ad script, on an integer scale of 1 to 5.

A CTA is the closing ask that tells the viewer exactly what to do next. Judge \
clarity/singularity of the ask AND whether it lands as an EARNED close, NOT \
how exciting the product is.

Rubric (calibrated with exemplars):
- 5 — One concrete action verb + one specific destination, unmistakable, AND
      it reads as the natural conclusion of the beat just before it (a
      connective, a callback, or a direct pickup of what was just said) rather
      than a cold restart.
      STRONG: "...the leather already looks broken in, right where you grab
      it. So go make it yours." (the CTA explicitly picks up "grab it" ->
      "make it yours")
- 4 — Single clear ask, slightly generic destination/verb, but still bridged
      to the line before it. e.g. "Shop now at the link below." following a
      beat that set up why, even if the destination itself is vague-ish.
- 3 — Present but soft/vague, OR clear but with a weak/incidental bridge; the
      viewer knows there is an ask but the transition or the destination is
      fuzzy. e.g. "Check it out." / "Learn more." (no destination, weak verb)
- 2 — Vague AND weak, or buried so the ask is barely a CTA at all.
- 1 — MISSING (script just ends), OR two or more COMPETING calls-to-action that
      split the viewer's attention.
      WEAK (competing): "Tap to shop the set — or visit our site to book a
      styling call, and don't forget to follow us!" (three asks = split intent)

SCORE DOWN RULE (disconnected/abrupt close): if the CTA line is a bare command
that shares no thread with the beat immediately before it -- no connective
("so"/"that's why"/"now"), no callback to what was just said -- cap the score
at 3 regardless of how clear the ask itself is. A clear ask that arrives as a
jump-cut still reads as tacked-on, not earned.
      WEAK (abrupt, capped at 3 even though the ask is clear): "...It's already
      getting darker right where her hands grab it. Grab yours before the next
      batch sells out." (the CTA doesn't pick up anything from the line before
      it -- it just starts a new, unrelated imperative)

HARD RULE: multiple competing CTAs must be penalised heavily (score 1-2), even if
each individual ask is well-phrased. Split calls-to-action measurably depress
conversion — one ad, one ask. Say so in the justification when you see it.

You are given, per variant: the CTA line (the last beat) and the closing beats
around it for context. Score the CTA AND its transition from the beat before it,
not the whole script.

Return ONLY a JSON object of this exact shape:
{"results": [{"variant_id": "<id>", "cta_score": <int 1-5>, "justification": "<one or two sentences naming the concrete reason>"}]}
Include exactly one entry per variant you were given. No prose outside the JSON.\
"""

_TONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a brand-tone critic for short-form video ads. Score ONLY brand/tone FIT \
of each script against the seller's brief and stated direction, on an integer \
scale of 1 to 5, and separately flag any hard "never do" violation.

Judge whether the script's VOICE, register, and energy match what the brief and \
the seller_direction (especially its mood words) ask for. A technically strong ad \
can still score LOW on tone if it is tonally wrong for THIS brand.

Rubric (calibrated with exemplars). Suppose the brief asks for a "quiet, tactile, \
handmade feel" with mood words like "calm, sensory, understated":
- 5 — Fully on-voice. STRONG: "Run your thumb along the ridge where the potter's
      hand pressed the clay. It stays warm long after the last sip." (calm,
      sensory, unhurried — matches the mood words)
- 3 — Mixed: mostly on-voice but with an off-register line or two.
- 1 — Tonally opposite. WEAK: "LIMITED TIME MEGA SALE!! 50% OFF — BUY NOW BEFORE
      IT'S GONE!!!" (hard-sell, high-urgency, shouty — the exact opposite of a
      quiet, tactile, handmade feel), even if its hook would grab attention.

The mismatch direction matters: a hard-sell / high-urgency script scores LOW when
the brief/mood words call for something calmer, and vice-versa. Explain the
specific mismatch (or match) in the justification.

OFF-VOICE PATTERN — spec-sheet/catalog copy: lines that merely name a physical
attribute with no claim, action, or viewer consequence score MAX 2 on tone
regardless of brand-fit. Examples:
- Score 2 max: "The tall glass sits perfectly on your table." / "Available in
  coral and orange." / "Two wicks provide even burn coverage."
- Score 4-5: "The kind of glow that makes a room feel like somewhere you actually
  want to be." / "You'll smell the orange peel before you even light it." / "One
  candle, the whole room."
The difference: spec-sheet copy describes the product TO the viewer. On-voice copy
describes what the product DOES FOR the viewer or what the viewer will EXPERIENCE.

PRODUCT-TITLE DUMP PATTERN: a line whose grammatical subject is a multi-word
product listing title or brand + category string, paired with a generic descriptor
or blanket endorsement ("fits perfectly", "works great", "looks beautiful",
"smells amazing", "is incredible"), scores MAX 2 on tone regardless of brand-fit.
This reads as a product-page listing read aloud, not a human voice — it stops the
flow and breaks register no matter how on-voice the lines around it are.
On-voice copy names what the product DOES for the viewer without front-loading the
full product name:
- Score 2 max: "[Full multi-word product title] fits perfectly." / "[Brand + product
  name] looks amazing." — listing title as subject, generic adjective as predicate.
- Score 4-5: "It disappears on your wrist — until someone asks where you got it." /
  "You stop noticing it the moment you put it on." — viewer-facing, no name dump.
Apply this cap even when the rest of the script is on-voice. A single name-dump
line mid-script is a register break for the whole piece.

CALIBRATION WITH SELLING CHARACTERIZATION: the selling_characterization in
the user content tells you what the buyer is actually paying for. If it says
the buyer is paying for a sensory/atmospheric/ritual experience, then a vivid,
specific sensory line IS on-voice for that product and should be scored on its
brand/mood fit alone — not penalized as spec-sheet. If it says the buyer is
paying for a functional outcome, a pretty-sounding-but-disconnected atmospheric
line is evasion and still caps at 2. Apply the same test as the body-checker:
for experience/ritual-led products, naming the sensation already is the payoff;
for function-led products, atmospheric language without consequence is evasion.

NEVER-DO HARD GATE:
- If seller_direction includes a "never_do" constraint, set "never_do_violation":
  true for ANY script that violates it — in letter OR in substance. Example: if
  never_do = "never mention discounts or sale pricing", then a script that says
  "20% off this week" or "grab it before the sale ends" violates it -> true.
- If there is no never_do constraint, or the script complies with it, set
  "never_do_violation": false.
- never_do_violation is INDEPENDENT of the tone_score: judge tone on its own
  merits, and set the violation flag on its own merits. (A script can be perfectly
  on-tone and still violate never_do, or be off-tone yet compliant.)
- This flag is a hard gate downstream: a true value removes the variant from
  consideration entirely, so only flag a genuine violation.

You are given: the brief, the seller_direction (may be null / may omit fields),
and each full script's text.

Return ONLY a JSON object of this exact shape:
{"results": [{"variant_id": "<id>", "tone_score": <int 1-5>, "never_do_violation": <true|false>, "justification": "<one or two sentences naming the concrete tone match/mismatch and, if flagged, the exact never_do violation>"}]}
Include exactly one entry per variant. "never_do_violation" MUST be a JSON boolean
(true/false), never a string. No prose outside the JSON.\
