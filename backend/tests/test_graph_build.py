"""
Integration test for the piece the derisk scripts never exercised: do the
Product Truth Extractor AND Concept Agent actually work when run *inside*
the compiled LangGraph graph, chained -- RunnableConfig injection,
adispatch_custom_event, state flowing from one node into the next, the whole
astream_events path -- not just as bare function calls.

Fakes only the network boundary (AsyncOpenAI construction inside each agent
module); everything else (StateGraph, checkpointer, astream_events, custom
event dispatch) is the real thing.

# agents) checks each script_quote against winning_script["text"], NOT against a
# beat's own line -- and v1's text ("Scratched already? This one shrugs it off.
