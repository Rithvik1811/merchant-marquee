"""
Phase 4 adversarial integration edge cases (independent review of the Continuity
retry loop). These target intersections the existing Phase 4 suite does NOT cover:

  * multi-round human review on the SAME shot (retry_with_edit that still drifts);
  * a shot that hard-FAILS Video-Gen during a Continuity-triggered retry, then
    falls back through Ken-Burns and terminates cleanly;
  * MAX_AUTO_RETRIES=0 (first drift goes straight to human review);
  * the "review" dead-end for an unknown resume value (clean termination);
  * DURABILITY of a human "approve" across LATER loop passes driven by a DIFFERENT
    shot -- this is the bug this file's fix addresses;
  * the Continuity Agent's real frame-extraction failure path through the FULL
    compiled graph (not just the isolated unit).

The full-graph tests drive graph.build.build_graph with every network boundary
faked exactly as tests/test_continuity_loop_e2e.py does; the gate-level tests
reuse tests/test_continuity_gate.py's small single-node harness.
