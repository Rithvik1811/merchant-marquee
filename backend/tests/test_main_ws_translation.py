"""
Test for app/main.py's on_custom_event -> C2 envelope translation, the one
piece test_graph_build.py doesn't cover (that test asserts on the raw
astream_events output, not on what the WebSocket handler does with it).

Replaces app.state.graph with a fake whose astream_events yields synthetic
events, so this exercises main.py's actual branching logic without needing
a real Ingest endpoint to feed real photos through a real run.
