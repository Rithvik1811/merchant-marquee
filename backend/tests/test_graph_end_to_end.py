"""
Full-pipeline end-to-end test: drive the ENTIRE compiled LangGraph in one shot,
from ingest-state through Ken-Burns Fallback, faking every network boundary and
asserting a genuinely coherent final state (not merely "it didn't crash").

Faked boundaries (every module that builds an OpenAI client):
  * agents.product_truth_extractor.AsyncOpenAI  (async)  — truth extractor
  * agents.concept_agent.AsyncOpenAI            (async)  — concept agent
  * agents.hook_checker.AsyncOpenAI             (async)  — Hook-Checker
  * agents.critic_llm.OpenAI                    (sync)   — Body/CTA/Tone/Meta
  * agents.treatment_agent.AsyncOpenAI          (async)  — Treatment Agent (§5.5)
  * agents.shot_list_agent.AsyncOpenAI          (async)  — Shot-List Agent (§5.6)
  * agents.video_gen_node._call_wan_video_gen   (async)  — Video-Gen Node (§5.8)
  * agents.ken_burns_fallback_node.render_ken_burns_clip + agents._oss.upload_video_to_oss
    — Ken-Burns Fallback Node (§5.9)

Everything else is real: StateGraph superstep scheduling, the checkpointer,
astream_events, custom-event dispatch, the Pacing-Checker (pure code), KR's real
Justification Validator (shared by Treatment + Shot-List agents), and the Budget
Gate (pure code, §5.7). The canned payloads are the single shared source of truth
in test_graph_build.py, reused here rather than reinvented.

Deliberate scenario chosen (and why). The shared FOUR_GOOD_VARIANTS fixture gives
each variant a single body beat, which makes meta_critic's merge candidate fail
the Merge Coherence Validator's pacing re-check unrepairably — so merge_validator
routes via "fallback" and the winning_script is variant v1's own unmerged
text/beats. That is the realistic path this fixture produces, so this test asserts
it honestly rather than forcing a "finalize".

For the Budget Gate we deliberately seed a job cap of $1.00 into the initial
budget_ledger. With three shots of 3s/4s/3s the per-shot 1080p ceilings sum to
$1.20 and the floors to $0.72, so $1.00 lands strictly inside the feasible band:
the water-filling allocation SUCCEEDS (no shot cut, no floor/over-cap case) and
the allocations sum to exactly the cap. This exercises the Budget Gate's normal
grounding-weighted distribution — the real outcome we want to assert on, chosen so
the test verifies a computed allocation rather than the degenerate floor branch a
too-loose default cap would trigger.
