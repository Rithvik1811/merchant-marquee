"""
Adversarial WIRED-TOGETHER edge cases for the Phase 1->Phase 2 pipeline.

The existing end-to-end test (test_graph_end_to_end.py) deliberately seeds a
loose-but-feasible cap ($1.00) so the Budget Gate exercises only its NORMAL
water-fill allocation branch: no shot is ever cut and the over-cap floor branch
never fires. That leaves two of the Budget Gate's three §5.7 branches completely
un-exercised in a real, wired-together graph run (they are only ever hit by
budget_gate's own unit tests, which hand-build Shot dicts directly rather than
letting the REAL Shot-List Agent's assembled output flow through them):

  1. The floor / over-cap branch (§5.7 step 4): cap too small to fit even the
     cheapest render of MIN_SHOTS shots -> every shot pinned to FLOOR_COST, the
     overage ACCEPTED and FLAGGED (over_cap=True), not hidden.
  2. The deterministic cut / reduce branch (§5.7): cap infeasible with N>MIN_SHOTS
     shots -> the single lowest-weight shot is dropped and the whole allocation
     retried, until it fits or the 3-shot floor is reached.

Branch (2) is UNREACHABLE with the shared fixture, because that fixture produces
exactly MIN_SHOTS (3) shots and the reduce loop bails to the floor case the moment
`len(working) <= MIN_SHOTS` -- so no amount of cap-tightening against the 3-shot
fixture can force a genuine cut. This file adds a 5-shot fixture (assembled by the
REAL Shot-List Agent through the REAL graph) specifically to drive that path.

Both tests reuse the real upstream fixtures / real Justification Validator / real
Budget Gate; only the network boundaries are faked, exactly as the shared e2e test
does.

The final test ORIGINALLY characterized a genuine latent bug (not a crash) found
while tracing the fallback path: `merge_validator._winning_script_from_fallback_variant`
preferred a variant's own polished `text` field over joining its beat lines, so
`winning_script["text"]` could diverge from `beats[].line` -- while both the
Treatment Agent and Shot-List Agent PROMPT the model to quote a beat's own line,
and KR's validator checks that quote against `winning_script["text"]`. A
correctly-instructed model response could therefore fail validation for no real
reason. THIS HAS SINCE BEEN FIXED (in `merge_validator.py` and, since the same
`variant.get("text") or ...` pattern existed there too, in `meta_critic.py`'s
single-survivor short-circuit) -- both now always join beat lines, matching the
normal cross-pollinated merge path's pre-existing, always-correct convention. The
test below now verifies the FIX holds against the real function, not a hand-built
dict that never actually exercised the buggy code path.
