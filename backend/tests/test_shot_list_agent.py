"""
Sanity-level coverage for the Shot-List Agent (§5.6). Same rationale as
test_concept_agent.py: the two-call justify->realize flow and its Call-A
re-prompt/fallback paths won't fire reliably against the real model on demand,
so they're exercised with a fake streaming client and pre-programmed JSON.

Deliberately not exhaustive: per docs/BUILD_TASKS.md this module gets an
independent second stress pass (the codebase's "never self-grade" posture), so
these prove the core flow is wired correctly, not every adversarial edge.
